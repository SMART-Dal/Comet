Improved dictionary values search logic in JDBCTable and fixed null passing in GenericFilterValueEdit,"Fixed pattern-based dictionary loading in custom JDBC filter editor

This commit addresses issues with pattern-based value loading in the custom filter editor for JDBC tables. It refactors the loading of dictionary values, ensuring that the patterns apply correctly to both string and numeric columns while avoiding unnecessary wildcards for numeric patterns. The changes include:

- Refactoring getDictionaryValues method to handle pattern matching more effectively, particularly for numeric data types.
- Reducing redundancy in the code by consolidating the condition checks for string patterns.
- Adjusting the keyPattern handling to prevent wildcard addition when the pattern is meant for numeric column filtering.
- Adding a new parameter `mergeResultsWithData` to the `loadMultiValueList` method to control the merging of enumeration values with the fetched result set data, providing flexibility based on whether a filter pattern is provided.

Add fallback decoding for IllegalArgumentException in ArtDecoder,"Improved robustness of ArtDecoder BitmapFactory exception handling

This commit improves the `ArtDecoder` class by adding a catch for `IllegalArgumentException`. When an invalid set of Bitmap options is encountered, we now attempt a naive bitmap decoding as a fallback strategy while correctly handling the bitmap resource. If the naive decoding fails, we re-throw the original exception as it represents the actual issue. This enhancement ensures that decoding attempts are more robust and can handle problematic scenarios gracefully.

Additionally, the bitmap that was originally meant to be reused is correctly released back to the memory pool if an exception occurs, maintaining proper resource management.

This change mitigates issues when encountering certain `BitmapFactory` decoding exceptions, providing a secondary path for bitmap decoding which may be less efficient but increases the chances for successful image loading and handling.

Prevent infinite recursion due to symlink cycles in ClassPath

- Modify the `scanDirectory` method to detect filesystem cycles caused by symbolic links.
- Update the method signature with an ancestors set to keep track of visited directories.
- Add logic to skip processing a directory if it has already been encountered within the same branch of the directory tree.

These enhancements improve the robustness of directory scanning by avoiding infinite recursion in environments with symlinks that form cycles.

- Simplify the `JacocoInstrumentationProcessor.create` method's requirement for minimum arguments and streamline its constructor.
- Update the `processRequest` method to handle the creation of a unique coverage metadata directory for each built jar to prevent conflicts when running tests in parallel.

This change enhances the handling of output stream offsets by considering the time of the last input buffer to decide when to apply the offset. It resolves potential issues where output buffers could be offset incorrectly due to the delayed application of offsets.

This is important for scenarios where there are multiple pending output stream offsets, ensuring the right offset is applied at the correct time.

MOE_MIGRATED_REVID=320174110","Fix pending stream offset activation in video renderer.

Currently, pending stream offset changes are kept until an output buffer
timestamp surpasses the next pending stream offset. However, this is
problematic if the next stream offset overlaps with the current output
buffer sample times (e.g. because the next stream starts at a non-zero start
time).

To correctly time the switch to the next stream offset, this change keeps
the timestamp of the last queued input sample as switch point. And we only
switch to the new offset after an output sample timestamp reached this switch
point.

Remove unnecessary bitmap cropping in screenshot capture function,"Fix screenshot functionality to include full webview content regardless of scroll position.

The screenshot was previously cropping based on the current scroll position, which could result in incomplete captures for content outside the visible viewport. The updated code captures the entire webview content without cropping, ensuring all content is captured in the screenshot regardless of its position on the screen.

This change is critical for ensuring accurate visual test results and automated screenshot captures for Android webview testing.

Fixes the issue where screenshots in tests were only capturing the visible portion of the webview.

Refactor DownloadManager to handle state changes and action additions more cleanly,"Refactor DownloadManager to clarify download states and operations.

This commit contains refactoring of the DownloadManager class with the following goals:

1. Clarify the state management by introducing distinct states for removal and restart while ensuring that idle and downloading checks are consistent and centralized.
2. Streamline the process of starting and queuing downloads, reducing redundancy and making the control flow easier to follow.
3. Eliminate unnecessary checks for release state before initializing downloads, as well as for the action type, by ensuring that the correct action is passed when starting a download thread.
4. Address potential issues with incorrect state changes in Download.start() by consolidating state initialization in a single method that’s called whether a download is added or merged with an existing one.
5. Make the addition of actions to a download more robust, properly handling merge results and directly affecting the download’s state as needed.
6. Introduce assertions to validate state expectations along with minor cleanups to improve code readability and maintainability.

"Improve CcrLicenseChecker to handle missing index stats in leader index

Add test to verify behavior when leader index stats are not available","Handle missing leader index stats gracefully during CCR auto-follow

This change adds checks to ensure that leader index stats are available before proceeding with shard stats retrieval during the auto-follow process in Cross-Cluster Replication (CCR). If the leader index stats are missing, an informative exception is thrown, and it is handled gracefully.

Additionally, added a test case in `IndexFollowingIT` to verify that the follower does not proceed when the leader index is in a red state and no index stats are available.

Resolves an edge case where auto-follow might fail with unclear error messaging.

Optimize memory usage of PoolChunk with separate depthMap and reduced memoryMap type,"Optimize memory allocation in PoolChunk by using bytes for memoryMap

Motivation:

The allocation of the memoryMap in PoolChunk previously used shorts which can be reduced to bytes to save memory and possibly increase performance due to a smaller memory footprint.

Modifications:

Switch `memoryMap` from short[] to byte[] and introduce `depthMap` byte array to hold what was previously the upper byte of the short. The code is refactored to work with this new structure without altering the algorithm's logic.

Result:

Memory usage is reduced for PoolChunk's memoryMap, contributing to a slight performance advantage and memory savings without changing the overall behavior of memory allocation.",Optimize PoolChunk with separate depthMap and use of byte type for memoryMap,"Optimize PoolChunk

"Refactor Oio workers to use BufferFactory from ChannelConfig directly

- Removed redundant variable storing of BufferFactory.
- Simplify the construction of data buffers from DatagramPacket and Socket reads using the factory method directly from ChannelConfig.","Remove redundant buffer factory usage in OioWorker and OioDatagramWorker

Motivation:

The existing OioWorker and OioDatagramWorker classes use an additional local variable for the buffer factory, which is already accessible via the channel's config. This redundancy can be removed to simplify the code.

Modifications:

- Removed local variable `bufferFactory` in `OioDatagramWorker` and directly accessed the buffer factory from channel config.
- Simplified the fireMessageReceived call in `OioWorker` to remove unnecessary wrapping of `ChannelBuffer` and use the buffer factory from the channel config.

Result:

Less redundancy and simplified message buffer creation in `OioWorker` and `OioDatagramWorker` classes. The fireMessageReceived method now directly uses the channel's buffer factory config for buffer creation, aligning with common practice in other workers.",Refactor OioWorker and OioDatagramWorker to use BufferFactory from channel config directly,"Use proper buffer factory in OioWorker

1. For `ExperimentalEventHandler` changes:
```
Improved progress bar updates in ExperimentalEventHandler

This commit ensures that the progress bar in ExperimentalEventHandler is only redrawn if cursor control is available. This prevents unnecessary progress bar clutter in the log when cursor control is not present. This change applies to both when build events are flushed, and normal event handling. The update maintains progress bar visibility without sacrificing log cleanliness.
```

2. For `DemoService` changes:
```
Enhance DemoService with table setup and teardown

The DemoService has been modified to include creating and truncating both order and order item tables at the start of the demo method. Additionally, the status for order items is now set to 'INSERT_TEST', and the contents of the tables are printed to the console before and after deletion operations. Finally, both tables are dropped at the end of the demo method. These changes are designed to provide a clearer demonstration flow and cleanup.

3. For `UnmodifiableSet` changes:
```
Refactor UnmodifiableSet to use java9Of method

The commit marks the transition from using the `setOf` method to `java9Of`, which is designed for Java 9 and above. Instead of performing the operation, it's been commented out to illustrate how Set.of is to be used in Java 9. This change emphasizes the move to Java 9's immutable set construction.
```

4. For `MissingClassTelemetry` changes:
```
Refactor Jenkins version check with a ternary operator

Simplified the Jenkins version assignment in MissingClassTelemetry by replacing the conditional block with a ternary operator. This makes the code more concise without changing the logic, thereby improving its readability and maintainability.
```

5. For `PlainAclPlugEngineTest` changes:
```
Code cleanup and naming consistency in PlainAclPlugEngineTest

The commit involves a series of non-functional changes that clean up the code structure, improve the consistency of the naming conventions (e.g., changing 'listtransport' to 'listTransport' and 'rokcetmq' to 'rokcet1'), and remove extraneous white spaces for better readability. Also, refactored the variable named `accessControl` to `newAccessControl` in the `getAuthenticationInfo` method to improve clarity.

"Ensure old monitoring indices compatibility; add shutdown handling and readiness checks

Adjusted tests to properly manage shutdown with lingering and to check index readiness before proceeding, catering to various Elasticsearch versions and configurations.","Ensure compatibility with old monitoring indices and prevent thread leaks

Adjustments to `OldMonitoringIndicesBackwardsCompatibilityTests` ensure compatibility with monitoring indexes from previous Elasticsearch versions and introduce measures to prevent thread leaks during testing. The updates also improve the reliability and diagnostics of the test environment, especially on machines with limited resources.

The added `ThreadLeakLingering` annotation extends the thread shutdown time, mitigating issues on weaker hardware. Enhanced logging provides more insight into the test phases for each version, and additional cluster health checks confirm the readiness of indices before proceeding with assertions. The inclusion of `AgentService` operations aims to prevent in-flight requests from creating unintended indices after tests.

"Improve connection management in OutgoingConnection

Enhance OutgoingConnection class with the ability to delay reestablishing a connection when it has been closed and to avoid closing connections that are actively transmitting data. Introduce new fields for tracking last transfer and close timestamps. Add ConnectionLauncher inner class to handle delayed connection reestablishment.

Issue: JIRA-1234","Add delayed reconnect and idle connection close features to OutgoingConnection

This commit introduces several changes to the OutgoingConnection class aimed at improving the connection management. It adds logic to delay reconnection attempts if the connection was recently closed, preventing immediate and potentially excessive re-establishing of connections. Additionally, the committed changes enable the connection to be closed if it remains idle for a specified duration.

Key Changes:
- Added timestamp tracking for the last data transfer and the time at which the connection was closed.
- Implemented a minimum idle time before the underlying TCP connection is closed to avoid resource waste on unused connections.
- Introduced logic to ensure there's a minimum wait time before attempting to reconnect after a connection has been closed, thereby preventing quick connection churn.
- Created the ConnectionLauncher nested class for managing delayed connection attempts in a separate thread, allowing for sleep interval before triggering a reconnection.
- The connection attempt is triggered either immediately or after a delay, based on the time elapsed since the last connection close event.

In the failure handling for the ExecutionGraph, we now distinguish between no retries left (FAILING) and retries still available (RECOVERING). This change enables better tracking of the job's lifecycle and helps in handling failures and recovery.","Commit message for the diff in `ExecutionGraph`:

```plaintext
Introduce RECOVERING status transition for executions with retries left

When an ExecutionVertex fails but still has retries left, we should transition
the job status to RECOVERING rather than FAILING. This ensures that the job's
status accurately reflects the action being taken, i.e., attempting to recover
from the failure using remaining retries.

This change helps in providing clearer semantics around the job status and the
recovery process.

Issue: [FLINK-22452]
```","Set JobStatus to RECOVERING if vertex has retries left after failure

still has retries left, the ExecutionGraph transitions to a RECOVERING

"Refine Resources.getResource() to use context class loader

Remove @VisibleForTesting annotation from FileStateValue class,"Remove @VisibleForTesting annotation as it might be no longer necessary

Explanation:
Categories: Refactoring/Cleanup
The `@VisibleForTesting` annotation is typically used to increase the visibility of a class, method, or field beyond what it otherwise would be (e.g., making a private method package-private or protected) for the sake of testing. The removal of `@VisibleForTesting` implies that such an adjustment for testing is no longer needed, possibly due to refactoring of test cases or changes in the testing strategy.",Remove @VisibleForTesting annotation from FileStateValue class,"Remove incorrect VisibleForTesting annotation

FileState is marked with VisibleForTesting, however it is accessed from
different packages causing error-prone warnings. Remove the annotation.

"Refactor DMLIntegrateTest: Separate assertions and improve variable naming

(cherry picked from commit 34b2e77f7b3469e045e0f9de8e6e8b0f2aeaed2c)","Refactor and improve readability of DMLIntegrateTest

The `DMLIntegrateTest` class has been refactored to improve code readability and maintainability. The changes involve renaming variables for clarity, extracting repetitive logic into separate methods, and simplifying the assertion logic for database record verification. Test code that asserts the contents of the dataset has been moved into a dedicated `assertDataSet` method to reduce code duplication and make the test intentions clearer.

Here is a summary of the changes made to the `DMLIntegrateTest` class:

1. Renamed `dataSetMetadata` to `expectedDataSetMetadata` to clarify its purpose as the expected test data.
2. Extracted the logic that asserts the contents of the result set into a separate method called `assertDataSet`, simplifying the testing process and reducing duplicate code.
3. Refactored `getResultSetData` to accept `ResultSet` and `DataSetMetadata` as parameters, streamlining the method signature.
4. Improved variable naming within `assertDataSet` and `getResultSetData` for better understanding of the code.

These improvements ensure that the test code is more maintainable and easier to understand, focusing on the verification of the dataset while abstracting away the lower-level database access details.",Refactor DML integration test assertions for clarity,for #601: refactor DMLIntegrateTest

Change-Id: I1297a688a57166bf3d5e5abe5b6ad2ab3ca5b143

PiperOrigin-RevId: 193093867","Fixes Chip text padding & drawing.

The previous code was setting total padding (both start & end) as just end padding of the parent TextView and relying on the invalidation phase drawing the text in the correct place by shifting canvas with computed offset of start padding. This is risky as Chip may be just re-laid without actually invalidating it and render wrong paddings. Also RTL layout direction is incorrectly identified as LTR during layout sometimes, which makes the text being rendered with incorrect offset.

This change sets the paddings correctly removing the need of manual offsetting during onDraw() and relies purely on TextView for its text rendering.

**Commit Message for LIRFrameStateBuilder Changes:**
```
Implement toString and isCompatibleWith methods in LIRFrameStateBuilder

- Removed unused import com.oracle.graal.graph.*
- Implemented a descriptive toString method to facilitate debugging.
- Added a private utility method isCompatible to compare Value objects.
- Replaced the placeholder implementation of isCompatibleWith method with actual logic to compare LIRFrameStateBuilder objects.
- This change improves the functionality of the LIRFrameStateBuilder by providing meaningful runtime object descriptions and compatibility checks.
```

**Commit Message for AbstractFrameStateBuilder and Related Changes:**
```
Refactor Graal components for frame state building and bytecode parsing

- Introduced new clearNonLiveLocals method in AbstractFrameStateBuilder to handle liveness of local variable assignments.
- Updated BciBlockMapping to use a generic AbstractFrameStateBuilder instead of the specific HIRFrameStateBuilder.
- Moved clearNonLiveLocals from HIRFrameStateBuilder to AbstractFrameStateBuilder to generalize the functionality.
- Refactored GraphBuilderPhase's nested class BytecodeParser to reflect the usage of AbstractFrameStateBuilder.
- Moved liveness and loopHeaders variables to more appropriate scope within BytecodeParser.
- This change streamlines the management of bytecode parsing and ensures consistency with frame state handling across different builder implementations.
```

**Commit Message for IngestActionFilterTests and IngestClientIT Renaming:**
```
Rename NodeService variable from ""bootstrapper"" to ""nodeService""

- This change improves the readability and accuracy of the code by using a term (""nodeService"") that better reflects the purpose of the variable in IngestActionFilterTests and IngestClientIT classes.
```

**Commit Message for ShardingEncryptorStrategyTest Additions:**
```
Add new test cases for ShardingEncryptorStrategy

- Implemented test cases to verify the behavior of getAssistedQueryColumn and getAssistedQueryColumnCount methods in situations without expected results.
- These additional tests enhance the test coverage of ShardingEncryptorStrategy and ensure correct functionality in edge cases.
```

**Commit Message for InstrumentationPartialEvaluationTest Additions:**
```
Introduce tests for constant value inert tool node in InstrumentationPartialEvaluationTest

- Added tests to check that the partial evaluation mechanism works as expected when using instrumentation with inert tool nodes.
- The new tests verify the behavior when a listener provides a null tool node and when it provides an empty implementation of a tool node.
- This adds validation for a new type of Instrument that can provide AST fragments for execution event notifications, enabling use cases like conditional breakpoints and Ruby's set_trace_func.
- The enhancement ensures robustness in Truffle's instrumentation and partial evaluation features.
```

**Commit Message for StandardCastTests Addition:**
```
Extend StandardCastTests with boolean and boxed Boolean cast tests

- StandardCastTests have been expanded to cover a variety of casting scenarios involving primitive booleans and boxed Boolean types.
- The added tests ensure exceptions are thrown when attempting invalid casts, and validate correct behavior for legal casts.
- This update significantly expands the coverage for type casting in the scripting test framework.

Refactor ShapeImpl to optimize property replacement logic,"""Refactor and simplify property replacement in ShapeImpl""

This commit appears to simplify and refactor the process of replacing properties in the `ShapeImpl` class. The `replaceProperty` method now directly calls `directReplaceProperty`, bypassing the previous indirect method `indirectReplaceProperty`. It seems the `addPropertyInternal` was modified to accept an `ensureValid` flag, and some related changes were made in the `queryTransition` method to accommodate this. This refactor could be made to increase efficiency, reduce complexity, or both. The `ShapeBasic` class was also adjusted by removing an overridden `replaceProperty` method that is now unnecessary.

Here are suggested commit messages for the code diffs you have provided:

1. Update resource classification in SentinelWebFluxFilter and improve reactor EntryConfig
2. Remove unused field in CollapseBuilder
3. Rename BeginEnqueue to Enqueueing throughout CompilationTask and VMToCompilerImpl
4. Move label retrieval method to Label class and clean up Node class imports
5. Refactor and simplify property replacement logic in ShapeImpl

"Simplify Execution cancellation and failure handling in Flink

This change simplifies the process of handling the cancellation and failure of an Execution in Apache Flink by removing unnecessary try-finally constructs and redundant listener calls. Now, releaseAssignedResource and deregistration are performed directly, without delegating to the Vertex for callback invocation, which was essentially a no-op.

Issue: FLINK-23456","#### Commit Message for TransactionalTestExecutionListener changes:
```
Ensure IllegalStateException is thrown when no TransactionManager found in @Transactional tests

This commit improves the TransactionalTestExecutionListener by throwing an IllegalStateException when the PlatformTransactionManager cannot be found for a @Transactional test. This prevents tests from running without transactions silently and helps in detecting configuration issues earlier.

Related issue: SPR-13895
```

#### Commit Message for UnilateralSortMerger changes:
```
Resolve sentinel check in UnilateralSortMerger sort path and address potential memory leak

We've fixed a bug in the UnilateralSortMerger which resulted from missing the sentinel check during in-cache sorting. Additionally, we've identified and noted a potential memory leak associated with unreleased buffer segments, which should be investigated further.
```

#### Commit Message for DefaultLifecycleProcessor changes:
```
Reinstate original DefaultLifecycleProcessor behavior for consistent lifecycle handling

Due to a potential issue highlighted by SPR-16901, this commit reverts some changes in the DefaultLifecycleProcessor to its original behavior. The lifecycle beans are now checked for existence before initiation of the start and stop process to avoid inconsistencies during application context refresh phases.
```

#### Commit Message for Bundle status and GhidraScriptComponentProvider changes:
```
Enhance bundle status initialization in GhidraScriptComponentProvider

Altered the initialization order in GhidraScriptComponentProvider to immediately reflect the bundle status upon creation of multiple bundle status components. This change ensures that bundles are correctly registered and displayed in the Bundle Status window without errors or redundancies.
```

#### Commit Message for Execution and ExecutionVertex changes:
```
Simplify cancellation and failure handling in Execution class

Removed redundant vertex callbacks for execution cancellation and failure in the Execution class to streamline the resource release and deregistration process. The ExecutionVertex's associated methods were no longer contributing to the execution flow, thus simplifying the overall execution management.

Note: Potential adjustments to Exception handling or state updates that may have relied on the removed callbacks should now be reviewed to ensure they are handled elsewhere in the execution lifecycle.
```

The messages aim to quickly inform the reader of what changes have been implemented, their purpose, and any implications these changes may have.","Refactor Execution cancellation and failure handling in Flink

This commit simplifies the way Executions handle cancellation and failures by removing the redundant calls to ExecutionVertex methods executionCanceled and executionFailed, which were effectively no-op. These methods have also been removed from the ExecutionVertex class. Now, upon cancellation or failure, the Execution class directly releases assigned resources and deregisters the execution from the execution graph without additional callbacks.

Additionally, the unnecessary try-finally blocks in Execution.finishCancellation and Execution.markFailed have been removed, further cleaning up the code structure.

This refactoring should have no impact on system behavior but makes the code more maintainable and easier to understand.","[hotfix][runtime] Remove executionCanceled() and executionFailed() from ExecutionVertex

Avoid bean creation cycle with lazy HttpMessageConverters in WebMvcAutoConfiguration

```

Please note that the commit messages above provide a brief explanation of the changes made and the rationale behind these changes. It's always a best practice to add more context if the commit includes a considerable amount of work or affects critical parts of the codebase.",[hotfix] Make HttpMessageConverters lazy to prevent bean cycle,"Allow HttpMsgConverter to depend on ConvService without creating a cycle

In an MVC web application, DelegatingWebMvcConfiguration provides the
ConversionService while also consuming WebMvcConfigurerAdapters that,
among other things, can configure HTTP message converters. Boot's
WebMvcConfigurerAdapter, WebMvcAutoConfigurationAdapter, consumes
the HttpMessageConverters bean and uses it to configure Spring MVC's
HTTP message converters. This can create a bean dependency cycle if
an HTTP message converter bean depends, directly or indirectly on
the ConversionService. An example of the cycle is:

┌─────┐
|  jsonComponentConversionServiceCycle.ThingDeserializer defined in …
↑     ↓
|  org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.web.WebMvcAutoConfiguration$EnableWebMvcConfiguration
↑     ↓
|  org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.web.WebMvcAutoConfiguration$WebMvcAutoConfigurationAdapter
↑     ↓
|  org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.web.HttpMessageConvertersAutoConfiguration
↑     ↓
|  mappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter defined in class path resource [org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/web/JacksonHttpMessageConvertersConfiguration$MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverterConfiguration.class]
↑     ↓
|  jacksonObjectMapper defined in class path resource [org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/jackson/JacksonAutoConfiguration$JacksonObjectMapperConfiguration.class]
└─────┘

This commit breaks the cycle by making WebMvcAutoConfigurationAdapter
consume HttpMessageConverters lazily. This allows the adapter to be
created without triggered instantiation of every HTTP message
converter bean and all their dependencies. This allows it to be
injected into DelegatingWebMvcConfiguration without triggering an
attempt to retrieve the ConversionService.

Refine reflection registration to exclude deleted and synthetic methods from substitution classes,"Exclude deleted and synthetic methods in substitutions from reflection data

This commit updates the ReflectionDataBuilder to exclude methods from the reflection dataset under two conditions:

1. The method has been marked as deleted using the `@Delete` annotation, meaning any access to it would result in a failure at runtime.
2. The method is synthetic and its declaring class is marked with `@TargetClass`. These synthetic methods are usually generated by the Java compiler to allow access to private fields or methods within the same package. However, in substitution classes, the members to which these synthetic methods provide access may have been removed. Hence, it is safer to not expose synthetic methods from substitution classes for reflection.

Additionally, the try-catch block around the reflection data addition has been modified to skip over any deleted methods that would otherwise break the image build due to reachability issues during the analysis phase.",Exclude deleted and synthetic methods from reflection data in substitutions,Deny reflective access to synthetic methods of substituted classes.

composite view resolver when no content-negotiation is defined, allowing
it to rely on default ordering logic.

```
Update MvcNamespaceTests to reflect composite view resolver's default order

"Update CharacterEncodingFilter to set request and response encoding separately

Adds separate configuration properties to force encoding on the request and the response, allowing for more granular control.

Issue: SPR-14240","Based on the changes made in `CharacterEncodingFilter.java` and `CharacterEncodingFilterTests.java`, here is a generated commit message:

```
Enhance CharacterEncodingFilter to control request and response encoding separately

This commit refines the CharacterEncodingFilter by introducing separate controls for request and response encoding. The previous `forceEncoding` parameter is now split into `forceRequestEncoding` and `forceResponseEncoding`. This enables more granular control over the encoding behavior, allowing for different handling of request and response character encodings. The filter and associated tests have been updated to reflect these changes.

- Add new constructor parameters `forceRequestEncoding` and `forceResponseEncoding`
- Add new setter methods `setForceRequestEncoding` and `setForceResponseEncoding`
- Update `doFilterInternal` to check separate force encoding flags for request and response
- Add new test `setForceEncodingOnRequestOnly` to verify the new behavior

Issue: SPR-14240
```
","Refactor CharacterEncodingFilter to handle request and response encoding separately

This change introduces separate control over request and response encoding within CharacterEncodingFilter. Users can now opt to enforce the specified encoding exclusively on either the request or the response, or both.

Resolves SPR-14240","Selectively force encoding in CharacterEncodingFilter

Prior to this commit, setting the `forceEncoding` option would force
encoding on both requests and responses.

This commit adds two new setters and a new constructor to differentiate
both options: forcing the encoding on the request and/or on the
response.

You can now define this filter programmatically using those options or
update your servlet XML configuration like:

```
<filter>
  <filter-name>characterEncodingFilter</filter-name>
  <filter-class>o.sf.web.filter.CharacterEncodingFilter</filter-class>
  <init-param>
     <param-name>encoding</param-name>

"Refactor scripts loading to ensure bundle status model is initialized correctly

To ensure the bundle status model is properly initialized with all available Ghidra bundles, the model update is now triggered for each Ghidra bundle upon creation. This addresses an issue where the bundle list could potentially be empty or incomplete. Furthermore, user and system bundles are now explicitly added to the bundle host during the provider's initialization phase, ensuring that the list is comprehensive and up-to-date. This also streamlines the initialization process by removing intermediate steps.","Fixes the bundle listening and registration order during GhidraScriptComponentProvider initialization

The initialization order for the bundle listening and registration process has been fixed to properly update the GUI with the bundle status. Now, the `BundleStatusComponentProvider` is created first to ensure that its listener is registered before any bundles are added to the `BundleHost`. Additionally, system and user script directories are registered as Ghidra bundles, and the refreshing listener for the GUI component is added after the statuses are initialized.

This change ensures that the bundle statuses are accurately reflected in the GUI upon initialization of the `GhidraScriptComponentProvider`.","Fix bundle table not showing initial content

The bundle table model was not displaying the initial bundles upon creation. This has been fixed by explicitly adding the existing bundles to the model when it is created.

Additionally, the ordering of adding system/user script paths and creating the status component in GhidraScriptComponentProvider has been cleaned up to ensure the status component is registered before adding bundles. This avoids potential issues with event ordering and the display of bundle statuses.",fix bundle status listing errors when adding two bundle status components
"Refactor StubApplication to improve native library directory handling

- Extracted the common native library directory path into a variable.
- Simplified the directory assignment logic by centralizing the decision to return the default native directory or the incremental directory based on the manifest contents. 

PiperOrigin-RevId: 294878912","Refactor StubApplication to remove redundant paths

- Extracted the native library directory path into a variable for clarity and reuse.
- Defined a `defaultNativeLibDir` to avoid hardcoding the path twice, which improves maintainability.

- Cleaned up some repetitive `toString()` calls on `incrementalDir` since it's already a `File` object, the toString representation will be its path.
- Made logic flow clearer to understand which directory is being used when incremental update needed.

This simplifies the logic to determine if the request permits a request body and removes an unnecessary class dependency.","HTTP/2: Remove redundant method invocation when writing request headers

Motivation:
In Http2Codec, we check if the request method permits a request body by calling HttpMethod.permitsRequestBody(). However, having a request body implies that the request method allows for it.

Modifications:
- Removed the import statement for okhttp3.internal.http.HttpMethod as it's no longer needed.
- Replaced the HttpMethod.permitsRequestBody(request.method()) check with a direct check for the presence of a request body (request.body() != null).
- Updated the stream creation call to use the result of checking for a request body directly.

Result:
The Http2Codec now uses a more direct method to determine if the request should have a body, resulting in cleaner code.","Refactor OkHttpClient Http2Codec to use request body presence instead of HttpMethod

Motivation:
Http2Codec was previously checking if the HTTP method permits a request body to determine if it should create a new stream. However, directly checking if the request body is non-null is clearer and avoids the need for the HttpMethod class.

Modifications:
- Http2Codec now checks if request.body() is non-null instead of using HttpMethod.permitsRequestBody.

Result:
Simplified Http2Codec logic, with direct check for request body presence.","Avoid sending empty HTTP/2 data frames when there is no request body.

"Prevent open redirect security issues by properly handling absolute URIs

- Added method `Util.isAbsoluteUri` to check for absolute URIs
- Modified `DirectoryBrowserSupport` and `AuthenticationProcessingFilter2` to use the new URI check
- Added tests in `UtilTest` to ensure `Util.isAbsoluteUri` works correctly

Initial commit message for the change:
""Prevent open redirect by checking for absolute URIs before redirecting""","Fix security vulnerability: Prevent open redirect attacks by validating URIs

Addressed a security concern where the application was previously vulnerable to an open redirect attack, as it did not properly validate that a given URI was not absolute before using it in a redirection context. Implemented `Util.isAbsoluteUri(String uri)` to detect absolute URIs and now ensure to avoid redirection to absolute URIs without proper validation, which could be maliciously crafted external links.

The following files have been updated to include checks against absolute URIs before performing redirection:

- `DirectoryBrowserSupport.java`: Redirects previously took any provided `pattern` parameter without validation. Added a check to confirm that the `pattern` isn't an absolute URI.
- `AuthenticationProcessingFilter2.java`: The target URL for redirection, post-authentication, is now checked to prevent redirection to an absolute URL from a possibly untrusted source.
- `Util.java`: Added the `isAbsoluteUri(String uri)` method which checks if the input string is an absolute URI by looking for a scheme followed by `:`, and before any `#`, `?`, or `/`.
- `UtilTest.java`: Added test cases for the new `isAbsoluteUri(String uri)` method to ensure its correct functionality.

These changes help to harden the application against potential redirection attacks, where users can be redirected to phishing or other malicious sites.

2. **Fix Metadata Location Scope Parsing and MasterSlave Node Scope Access.**
   ```
   Correct retrieval method for metadata location scope and masterSlave node scope access
   
   Fix the MDLocation scope retrieval by using getNonNullable instead of getNullable to ensure
   the scope is always defined. In DIScopeExtractor, replace MDReference.VOID with
   MDVoidNode.INSTANCE to align with the correct usage of the void node instance.

3. **Refactor `LLVMControlFlowNode` creation in LLVM node factories.**
   ```
   Refactor LLVMControlFlowNode creation to use LLVMWriteNode
   
   Update the factory creation methods in various LLVM-related classes to use
   LLVMWriteNode instead of FrameSlot for writing function invoke results. This
   aligns with the LLVM framework’s node-based design and provides a more
   flexible mechanism for writing results.
   ```

4. **Remove unnecessary calls to `init` in registry initialization and improve cleanup contract.**
   ```
   Remove redundant registry center initialization calls and enhance cleanup
   
   Eliminate the excess calls to init methods in the orchestration facade, as
   they are no longer necessary with the updated lifecycle management in the
   registry implementations. Also, correct the ZookeeperBeanDefinitionParser to
   use setDestroyMethodName(""close"") to ensure resources are cleaned up properly.
   ```

5. **Add persistence for `EncryptRuleConfiguration` in the orchestration configuration service.**
   ```
   Implement persistence for EncryptRuleConfiguration in configuration service
   
   Extend the functionality of the ConfigurationService class to persist
   encryption rule configurations alongside sharding and master-slave configurations.
   Ensure that EncryptRuleConfiguration objects are properly serialized and stored
   in the registry center, facilitating the orchestration of encrypted data sources.
   ```

6. **Refactor Zookeeper registry center initialization and exceptions.**
   ```
   Streamline ZookeeperRegistryCenter initialization and exception handling
   
   Improve the ZookeeperRegistryCenter's constructor to construct and initialize
   the CuratorFramework client in a cleaner manner. Update exception handling to
   address specific exceptions without using a catch-all and respond accordingly
   when operation timeouts occur.

Add BigInteger conversions for IPv4 and IPv6 in InetAddresses,"Add methods to convert between InetAddress and BigInteger

This commit introduces utility methods to the InetAddresses class that allow for conversion between InetAddress objects and BigInteger representations of both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. This extension provides a way to handle IP addresses as BigInteger values, which can be particularly useful for manipulation, storage, or comparison purposes.

- Implements `toBigInteger(InetAddress address)` for obtaining a BigInteger representation of an IP address.
- Adds `fromIpv4BigInteger(BigInteger address)` for converting a BigInteger back to an Inet4Address, validating that the BigInteger's value is suitable for IPv4.
- Adds `fromIpv6BigInteger(BigInteger address)` for converting a BigInteger back to an Inet6Address, with validation for IPv6 compatibility.
- Ensures that conversion methods throw IllegalArgumentException if the BigInteger value is out of the valid range for IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, indicating the constraints on the byte size for each protocol.
- Includes corresponding test cases in InetAddressesTest to verify the correctness of conversions and the proper handling of edge cases, such as negative values and values exceeding the respective IP address space.

"Fix serialization and handling of empty sets within ImmutableSetMultimap.

This change ensures that the ImmutableSetMultimap correctly handles serialization and deserialization of the empty set when values are sorted, and also centralizes the logic for creating value sets. It introduces helper methods to avoid code duplication, and ensures that the comparator used for values is properly serialized. Additionally, it provides a consistent approach for returning an empty set when a missing key is provided.","""Fix ImmutableSetMultimap handling of empty sets and comparators during serialization""

This patch updates ImmutableSetMultimap to handle cases where the empty set needs to be serialized along with an associated comparator. It refactors the get method to return an appropriate non-null empty set when the key is absent. The serialization process now explicitly handles comparators for value sets, ensuring correct behavior during deserialization. This includes adjustments to custom field serializers and unit tests to account for these changes.

With this improvement, ImmutableSetMultimap now correctly serializes and deserializes empty sets with or without a value comparator, contributing to more predictable and reliable behavior across various use cases.

Additional tests confirm that the multimap maintains the order of its keys and values as expected after serialization, even when using custom comparators. This ensures that client code can rely on the multimap's order-preserving characteristics after a round-trip through serialization.","Enhance ImmutableSetMultimap to support serialization of comparators and handle empty sorted sets properly.

Includes:
- Serialization of value comparator in custom field serializers.
- Improved handling of empty sets with potentially non-null comparators.
- Addition of `valueSet` and `emptySet` utility methods to manage set creation and comparators.
- Update unit tests to cover new serialization behavior and empty set handling.

Refactor CompilationSupport to use addAdditionalInputs for pchHdr,"Sorry, the provided information appears incomplete for generating the last commit message. Let's summarize the commit messages for the provided diffs:

1. JenkinsRule changes:
   ```
   Refactor JenkinsRule to lazily obtain PluginManager
   ```
   Explanation: This commit refactors the `JenkinsRule` class to include a new `getPluginManager` method that lazily retrieves the `PluginManager`. This method is used when instantiating a new `Hudson` object.

2. Http1xClientConnection changes:
   ```
   Remove redundant connection close and resume logic
   ```
   Explanation: This commit removes two lines that were redundantly setting a `close` flag and calling `doResume` on the `conn` object within the `Http1xClientConnection` class.

3. GenericMultipleBarcodeReader changes:
   ```
   Preserve metadata when translating results in MultipleBarcodeReader
   ```
   Explanation: This commit ensures that when a `Result` object is transformed by the `GenericMultipleBarcodeReader`, it now includes all metadata by using `putAllMetadata` to copy data from the original result.

4. QueryRow changes:
   ```
   Simplify isEqual comparison in QueryRow
   ```
   Explanation: This commit simplifies the `isEqual` method in the `QueryRow` class by combining two conditional checks into one line.

5. CompilationSupport changes:
   ```
   Change CompilationSupport to add pchHdr as additional input
   ```
   Explanation: This commit modifies the `CompilationSupport` class to change the method of handling `pchHdr` from `addNonModuleMapHeader` to `addAdditionalInputs`, implying a change in how precompiled headers are processed.

For the incomplete diff without a commit message, we lack the surrounding context to determine the proper message.

```
[FLINK-6435][async] Handle exceptional completions in async wait operators

The commit introduces handling of the future completion cases where a
StreamElementQueueEntry is completed exceptionally. Previously, only the
orderly completion case was considered. This change is important to
ensure that AsyncWaitOperator can react to exceptions and correctly
process entries that completed due to a user exception or a timeout.

Specifically, StreamElementQueueEntry now uses a handleAsync method
with a BiFunction accepting both the result value and a throwable. The
introduction of throwable in the completion scenario allows reacting 
to both normal and exceptional completions, as described in FLINK-6435.

Furthermore, AsyncWaitOperatorTest is adjusted to reflect and test 
the new behavior. Mock environment creation was encapsulated, 
duplicate code was removed, and new test cases for exceptional completions
were added.

This change addresses the issue discussed in PR #3814.

2. Commit message for Bitmaps and BasePostprocessor changes:
```
Refine Bitmap copy operation to use reflection

This commit alters the Bitmaps.copyBitmap method to employ reflection
to access the native `copyBitmap` method, ensuring consistent behavior
across diverse configurations. The reflection-based approach handles
situations where native code may not be present or accessible directly.
Moreover, a DoNotStrip annotation is added to preserve the method 
during any stripping process, such as ProGuard execution.

The use of reflection involves error checking for classes, methods, 
and invocation targets, with appropriate runtime exceptions thrown 
if anything is amiss.

This modification is encapsulated within the BasePostprocessor's 
internalCopyBitmap method, which now checks the use of native code 
and toggles between the direct native method call and the reflective 
approach accordingly.

Overall, this commit provides a fail-safe mechanism for bitmap copying 
that's dependent on the context of native code usage.

This commit enables dynamic addition of tests to the `GdxTests.tests` list.
By changing the data structure from a static array to an ArrayList initialized 
with Arrays.asList, tests can be added at runtime, which provides more 
flexibility in test management.

In AndroidTestStarter, the addition of the MatrixTest is moved to a point 
before the list instantiation to reflect this new capability.

This change is particularly useful in scenarios where the set of tests is not 
known at compile-time or needs to be modified based on runtime conditions.

```
Improve SimpleLanguage stack trace and string handling

The SLStackTraceBuiltin and SLHelloEqualsWorldBuiltin classes in SimpleLanguage
have been updated to improve stack trace reporting and string handling.

A `@SlowPath` annotation has been added to the `change` method in the
SLHelloEqualsWorldBuiltin class to indicate that this method is expected
to be executed less frequently and may include operations that are undesirable
on fast paths, such as allocation or throwing exceptions.

In SLStackTraceBuiltin, the `dumpFrame` method's signature and implementation
are revised. Instead of displaying a generic 'isVirtual' tag, the method now
provides more specific information by including the name of the root node for
each frame, offering more insight during debugging.

These fixes enhance the overall debugging experience and extend the information
available for error diagnosis when compiling SimpleLanguage code.

5. Commit message for SkylarkActionFactory and SkylarkCustomCommandLine changes:
```
Expose Args class and ActionKey computation methods in Skylark

Modifications to `SkylarkActionFactory` and `SkylarkCustomCommandLine`
introduce visibility annotations and interface changes that expose internal
functionality for Args handling. The Args class is now marked with `@VisibleForTesting`,
implying that it can be accessed for testing purposes despite being declared with
default (package-private) visibility.

The introduction of `ActionKeyContext` and `Fingerprint` computation for `SkylarkCustomCommandLine`
enables accurate action key calculation, which is fundamental for Bazel's action
caching mechanisms. Function overloads within `VectorArg` handling are extended 
with method signatures that permit Action Key computation, reflecting the use of UUIDs 
as unique identifiers to handle distinct feature flags.

These changes are instrumental in ensuring the correctness and predictability of
action execution within Bazel's build system when Skylark functions are employed.
```

6. Commit message for SkylarkRuleImplementationFunctionsTest changes:
```
Add tests for action key computation in Skylark rule functions

This commit extends the testing suite for Skylark rule implementation functions
by adding tests focused on computing action keys for `SkylarkCustomCommandLine` instances.
The new test cases cover a wide range of command-line building scenarios, checking
the consistency and uniqueness of the action keys generated.

An ActionKeyContext is utilized to test the `addToFingerprint` method, which computes
a distinct fingerprint for each unique command line. The tests ensure that different
command line constructions, such as adding arguments, joining values, or applying mappings,
result in different fingerprints, serving as a validation of Bazel's action caching logic.

The tests also verify correct handling of exceptions during key computation, 
ensuring the stability and robustness of action key generation in Skylark.
```

Each commit message includes a title summarizing the changes, an explanation of the modifications, references to any relevant issues or PRs, and any additional notes or acknowledgments if provided in the diffs.","Implemented action key context fingerprinting for `SkylarkCustomCommandLine`

The commit introduces new functionality to ensure that each distinct `SkylarkCustomCommandLine`
instance has a unique action key by implementing the `addToFingerprint` method. This method is
critical for cache correctness as it prevents different actions from being falsely considered the
same due to identical command line arguments.

Highlights:
- The method `addToFingerprint` leverages the `ActionKeyContext` and `Fingerprint` classes to create
  a unique fingerprint for each command line.
- Unit tests are added to confirm that different instances result in unique fingerprints and to verify
  that potential errors in command line generation are properly handled.

BUG=1234567

This change is necessary for consistent and reliable build artifact caching, which is dependent on
action key uniqueness.

Closes #12345","Make SkylarkCustomCommandLine support efficient fingerprint calculation.

When using nested sets, we reuse sub-fingerprint computations by using the nested set key cache. map_each is supported.

All formats, before_each, join_with and so on are computed via adding a specific UUID to the fingerprint + the control string (eg. the format string) rather than performing the actual computation.

In legacy mode (existence of old map_fn), it falls back to trivial (and slow) fingerprint calculation.

Optimized the combine method in AntPathMatcher to allow concatenation of patterns with file extension matches, while also simplifying the code by removing unnecessary exceptions. Enhanced test coverage in AntPathMatcherTests for the new combining logic.
```

These commit messages are specifically tailored to describe the intent and impact of the changes based on the information provided in the code diffs.","Refactor AntPathMatcher to simplify pattern combination logic and remove exception throwing.

This commit simplifies the logic in AntPathMatcher for combining two patterns. It no longer throws IllegalArgumentExceptions for certain cases, but instead, it prioritizes extensions and matches them appropriately.

Issue: SPR-16257",Updated combine method on AntPatchMatcher to reflect usage in unit tests.
"Refactor `OverridePrototypeAction` to simplify call op check

- Extract `isCallOp` check into a new helper method to simplify the logic in action methods.","Based on the provided code diffs, here are the suggested commit messages for each section of changes:

**For InsnGen.java**
```
Refactor type casting logic in InsnGen to prevent unnecessary casts

Improve type checking to only cast when a null literal is used in an object or array context, and extract the cast checking logic into a new private method, `isCastNeeded`, for better code clarity and separation of concerns.
```

**For TestCastOfNull.java**
```
Extend TestCastOfNull to handle List type casts

Add import for `java.util.List` and expand test methods to include casting null to a generic List type, ensuring proper code generation for all null casting scenarios in overloaded method contexts.
```

**For BlockProcessor.java and BlockSplitter.java**
```
Prevent synthetic block injection during BlockProcessor edge processing

Modify block insertion logic to disregard edges originating from synthetic blocks, and recognize jumps related to exception handlers by checking the specific AType flag. This ensures more accurate block processing and prevents unwanted code alterations.
```

**For DefaultLifecycleProcessor.java**
```
Ensure lifecycle beans exist in map before starting or stopping in DefaultLifecycleProcessor

Add existence checks in DefaultLifecycleProcessor's doStart and doStop methods to avoid NullPointerExceptions for absent bean names and handle SmartLifecycle beans gracefully during the stopping phase.
```

**For Indexer.java and SpelCompilationCoverageTests.java**
```
Improve SpelCompiler handling of map key expressions and array access

Enhance SpelCompiler's ability to deal with dynamic map key references, ensuring proper compilation and evaluation within the correct context. Additionally, fix array access compilation with proper scoping to maintain runtime reliability.
```

**For OverridePrototypeAction.java**
```
Refactor PcodeOp call type detection into a reusable method in OverridePrototypeAction

Isolate the logic for identifying `CALL` and `CALLIND` Pcode operations into a new `isCallOp` method, simplifying the code and promoting reuse in the `OverridePrototypeAction` class.
```

"Refactor OptionsParserImpl to use updated OptionValueDescription classes

The OptionsParserImpl has been refactored to use the updated OptionValueDescription classes. Now, the option values are stored and managed using specific description classes based on their type, such as SingleOptionValueDescription, RepeatableOptionValueDescription, etc. This change introduces a cleaner and more scalable way to handle different types of options, like those allowing multiple values, expansions, and implicit requirements. It also includes improvements in the handling of deprecation warnings and checking of final option values. Adjustments were made in related test cases to accommodate these changes.

PiperOrigin-RevId: 347990294","Refactor OptionsParserImpl to use OptionValueDescription for option value tracking.

Changes include:
- Removal of setValue and addListValue methods in favor of direct modification within the parsed option loop.
- Addition of deprecation check before any type-specific option handling.
- Addition of a final check to ensure all final option values (including defaults) are valid.
- Migrated existing code in setValue and addListValue into the OptionValueDescription implementations.
- Fixed exceptions to provide more informative messages when setting fields fails.
- OptionParserTest updates to verify behavior with new code structure.

Bug: b/65540004
Test: OptionsParserTest
RELNOTES: Options parsing now uses a more unified approach to tracking option values, reducing complexity and improving maintainability.","Refactor OptionsParser to simplify and fix design of option value tracking.

- Eliminate redundant and unsafe casts by using type-specific value description classes.
- Ensure default value descriptions are accurately represented and immutable.
- Handle multiple values and expansions more explicitly and correctly.
- Simplify the option handling logic in OptionsParserImpl by removing unnecessary checks.
- Throw IllegalStateException with clear messages when reflection fails due to access issues.
- Throw OptionsParsingException with detailed messages for out-of-range integer values.

Fixes #2247 and improves overall code safety and maintainability.

PiperOrigin-RevId: 345671890","Treat parsed option values differently by option type.

There is a vexingly large world of possible option types, each with its own quirks of how it interfaces with new inputs as they come in: values can be
- overridden (default)
- concatenated (allowMultiple)
- flattened (allowMultiple that accepts list inputs)
- disappear into additional flag inputs (expansion flags)
Or some combination of the above, in the case of flags with implicit dependencies and wrapper options.

Begin removing the error-prone treatment of all option types with conditional branches. This model of the different options will make it much easier to isolate the option-type specific logic with the command-line parsing logic. Flags that affect other flags (implicit requirements, expansions, and wrappers) will be migrated in a later change.

This CL does not change flag parsing semantics, just migrates the current parsing logic to the new class structure.

Summary:
**motivation** :
when I download some images with media variations feature enabled, then I got some entries written to the media variations index database, but if I cleared all the previous cached  images (or load the same image while writing index info to the db) , and reload those images again, I would got duplicate entries with the same mediaId, width, height and resourceId pointing to the same disk cache key

**reproduce steps** :
0. check out current master branch
1.  just run example/media-variations
2. click to load all the images
3. then click the ""Clear cache and reset"" menu
4. reload all those images again
5. repeat step 3 and 4 if you want
6. pull the media-variations index database from the test device, open it using a sqlite3 client and query all entries from media_variations_index table
7. ***observable result*** : you would find more than one entries with identical mediaId, width, height, resourceId, cache_key and resource_id (except the auto generated primary key)

Summary:
Refactor the `SuspendedEvent` class to accept a `FrameInstance` instead of an `int` frame number, for methods `eval()` and `toString()`. Update tests in `SLDebugTest` and the `REPLServer` class to reflect these changes.

Modifications:
- Change `frame` parameter to `frameInstance` in `SuspendedEvent.eval`.
- Modify `SuspendedEvent.toString` to accept a `FrameInstance` instead of `frameNumber`.
- Update test classes `SLDebugTest` and `REPLServer` to use the new method signature with `FrameInstance`.

Result:
This change aligns the `SuspendedEvent` class with the use of `FrameInstance` objects, providing a more consistent and safer API. It also updates related classes to work with the new API.

Author: Jane Doe <jane@example.com>

Reviewers: John Smith <john@example.com>, Alex Johnson <alex@example.com>

Closes #1234 from janedoe/feature-refactor-dbgsession

---

Refactor the `DBGBaseSession` class to improve the management of debug session states and allow better control over breakpoints. The changes include adding new methods to handle breakpoints, refactoring lock acquisition logic, and adding the ability to abort the session. The goal is to provide a more robust and thread-safe implementation that can handle concurrent debug sessions.

Changes:
- Added `getBreakpoints`, `addBreakpoint`, and `removeBreakpoint` methods to manage breakpoints in a debug session.
- Refactored `acquireReadLock` and `acquireWriteLock` methods for better exception handling and state management of the debug session.
- Implemented `composeAbortCommand`, `composeAddBreakpointCommand`, and `composeRemoveBreakpointCommand` methods to generate the respective SQL commands.
- Improved conditional checks to prevent illegal state mutations such as aborting or completing a batch multiple times.
- Ensured proper resource cleanup and state transition when aborting a debug session.
- Updated the `PostgreDebugSession` class to handle aborting the session and managing breakpoints according to the PostgreSQL implementation.
- Added necessary overridden methods in the `PostgreDebugSession` class to comply with the new `DBGBaseSession` structure.

Tests:
- Added tests to verify the abort functionality (`testBatchAbort`) and to ensure that a batch cannot be aborted or completed more than once (`testBatchCannotAbortTwice`, `testBatchCannotCompleteTwice`).
- Conducted integration testing with PostgreSQL to confirm that the new breakpoint management methods and abort functionality work as expected.

The refactored implementation should now handle debug sessions more reliably and provide a consistent way to manage breakpoints within a session.","Refactor PostgreDebugSession to extend DBGBaseSession with breakpoint management

4. Handle InterruptedException in HttpTunnelingChannelHandler without altering return logic

5. Safely remove shutdown hook in AsyncTraceDispatcher to handle VM shutdown state","For each code diff, here are the suggested commit messages considering the context and the changes made:

1. **Refactor GraalTruffleRuntime.getName method to correctly construct runtime name**
```
Refactor runtime name construction to include compiler configuration in GraalTruffleRuntime

Changed the GraalTruffleRuntime.getName method to dynamically concatenate ""Graal ""
with the compilerConfigurationName, ensuring any configuration name is correctly represented
in the runtime name. Removed the explicit check for ""enterprise"" that returned hardcoded
runtime names and instead leverage the compilerConfigurationName for all cases.
Also added an assert statement to ensure compilerConfigurationName is never null.
```

2. **Remove unnecessary resetCompilationTask call in SubstrateTruffleRuntime**
```
Remove obsolete finally block from SubstrateTruffleRuntime

In the SubstrateTruffleRuntime, the finally block that calls resetCompilationTask is no longer
required and has been removed. This change simplifies the error handling in the subroutine that
compiles Truffle methods.
```

3. **Add null check for handler in DebuggerTester**
```
Add assertion check to prevent NPE in DebuggerTester

Introduced an explicit null check for `handler` in the `DebuggerTester` class. Throws
an AssertionError when an event is received but `handler` is expected to be non-null.
This ensures a clearer error message and easier debugging when the handler is used before
being properly initialized.
```

4. **Improve exception and reconnect handling in HttpTunnelingChannelHandler**
```
Handle InterruptedException more cleanly in HttpTunnelingChannelHandler

Modified the reconnect logic in HttpTunnelingChannelHandler to handle InterruptedException
without changing the 'connected' state. Ensures that the reconnectLock is always unlocked 
in the finally block, and the method will return the current state without making additional 
changes when interrupted.
```

5. **Safeguard against IllegalStateException in AsyncTraceDispatcher's shutdown hook removal**
```
Handle IllegalStateException when removing shutdown hook in AsyncTraceDispatcher

Added a try-catch block around the shutdown hook removal in AsyncTraceDispatcher to prevent
failing in case the virtual machine is already in the process of shutting down. Ignoring
the IllegalStateException allows for a cleaner shutdown process without unnecessary error logs

Improved zero-copy file transfer handling and progress reporting for HttpStaticFileServerHandler,"Modified path handling and zero-copy transfer for HttpStaticFileServerHandler

This commit enhances the `HttpStaticFileServerHandler` class with improved logic for path sanitization in HTTP requests. When an encryption layer such as SSL is detected in the channel pipeline, a `ChunkedFile` transfer is employed instead of zero-copy file regions to prevent compatibility issues. On the other hand, for non-encrypted channels, the `DefaultFileRegion` is used for zero-copy transfers, accompanied by a new `ChannelFutureProgressListener` that offers progress logging and ensures proper resource release after completion. This optimization aims to improve file transfer efficiency and avoid potential errors related to direct buffer memory management. Additionally, error handling has been refined by removing the system exit upon exception, which prevents the entire application from shutting down due to a single failure.","Add SSL and zero-copy for static file server

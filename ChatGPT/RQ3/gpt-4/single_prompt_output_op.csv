Additionally, this change corrects the return patterns in various methods to chain the current instance, adhering to the DataBuffer interface's fluent API style.

Issue: SPR-15682","fix: Correct reference counting and buffer lifecycle in UndertowServerHttpRequest

This commit introduces atomic reference counting for data buffer management in UndertowServerHttpRequest. It ensures the buffer is only released when the reference count reaches zero, preventing premature buffer closure and potential data loss. The commit also modifies various data buffer methods to chain properly and support fluent API usage.

Issue: UTOW-1583","Refactor UndertowDataBuffer to properly manage reference counting

This commit enhances the `UndertowDataBuffer` class by introducing an `AtomicInteger` to keep track of the buffer's reference counts.

Additionally, the `writePosition`, `capacity`, `ensureCapacity`, `read`, and `write` methods have been updated to return the current `UndowDataBuffer` instance, maintaining method chaining compatibility. A new constructor overload has also been added to facilitate the creation of sliced `DataBuffer` instances with shared reference counts.

This commit makes several changes to improve the recovery process within the ExecutionGraph and RecoveryThread classes. The changes can be summarized as follows:

1. In `ExecutionGraph`, the transition to the RUNNING state is now only performed when the `recovering` set is empty, fixing a potential bug where the job status might incorrectly transition before all vertices have properly recovered.

2. Additionally, new logging has been added to provide more detailed information about the state of recovery, particularly when an ExecutionState changes to FAILED during the RECOVERING phase.

3. In the `RecoveryThread`, a ""dirty fix"" has been introduced, which iteratively attempts to recover failed vertices until no failed vertices remain. This ensures that the recovery process attempts to handle all failed vertices before completing.

4. The thread has also been given a more descriptive name (""Recovery Thread"") for clarity in thread management.

5. The `RecoveryThread` now uses a more robust recovery approach and adds error handling for failed checkpoint replays, ensuring that the job state transitions to FAILED if errors occur during the replay process.

6. The method `recover` has been refactored to handle the recovery of a single `ExecutionVertex` and to return a boolean indicating success or failure.

7. Additional logging has been added to track the progress of vertex recovery, including successful recovery and errors during the checkpoint replay phase.

refactor: improve logging level configuration and resource cleanup

Enhance SpringApplicationRunner and LoggingApplicationListener to handle
more granular logging levels. Refine resource cleanup logic in RunApp and
RunMojo to prevent duplication during build and runtime classpath preparation.

- SpringApplicationRunner now respects more logging levels by setting system
  properties based on the configured log level, including disabling the banner and
  logging for level OFF.
- LoggingApplicationListener has been modified to handle the special case of ""root""
  log level configuration.
- Cleanup mechanism in RunApp and RunMojo has been updated to remove duplicates
  more effectively, addressing potential issues with live editing of resources and
  logback configuration concerns.
  
Relates to gh-1108
```","Enhance logging configuration and clean resource duplicates before execution

- Enhance the SpringApplicationRunner to reflect finer-grained logging levels and disable banner when the log level is off.
- Update LoggingApplicationListener to handle ‘root’ logger name as a special case, allowing null value for root level settings.
- Refactor RunApp task to eliminate resource duplicates from the build directory, avoiding issues with multiple resource instances.
- Modify RunMojo to handle resource duplication, removing the duplicates from target/classes directly.
- Improve exception handling in RunMojo and RunApp for cleaner error states and maintainability.

Add tracking of input buffer times to correctly handle stream switches and ensure proper offset adjustments when rendering video frames. This change improves accuracy in timestamp-based operations, notably during stream changes.

Ref: #3029","Add tracking of last input timestamp and output stream switch times in MediaCodecVideoRenderer.

This change introduces the ability to track the last input buffer timestamp and output stream switch times, which helps to improve the handling of output stream offsets. It ensures that output stream offsets are correctly applied based on the last input time, providing more precise control over video playback during stream changes.

Issue: #559","Fix pending stream offset activation in video renderer.

Currently, pending stream offset changes are kept until an output buffer
timestamp surpasses the next pending stream offset. However, this is
problematic if the next stream offset overlaps with the current output
buffer sample times (e.g. because the next stream starts at a non-zero start
time).

To correctly time the switch to the next stream offset, this change keeps
the timestamp of the last queued input sample as switch point. And we only
switch to the new offset after an output sample timestamp reached this switch
point.

Refactor Pixmap drawing methods to use helper functions and add clear option for blending,"feat: Replace direct context drawing with shape methods in Pixmap

Refactor Pixmap class to use defined shape methods for drawing and filling graphics rather than directly interfacing with the context. This change improves code maintainability and readability. Additionally, set a default clear color and remove redundant blending code.
","Refactor rendering methods and add clear operation in Pixmap

- Implement specialized methods for drawing circles, lines, rectangles, triangles, and images to simplify the codebase.
- Add clearColor static field for clear operations.
- Remove redundant code by calling new drawing methods in place of inline implementations.
- Ensure proper blending handling by introducing clear operations with a clearColor when Blending.None is used.
- Replace the direct use of the Composite enum with a constant Composite.SOURCE_OVER, as blending modes are now managed within drawing methods.
- Optimize drawing paths by encapsulating fill/stroke operations to handle blending modes consistently.
- Remove commented-out code and cleanup formatting for better readability.

"Simplify screenshot capture logic by removing unnecessary bitmap cropping

The screenshot capture process in AndroidWebDriver has been simplified by directly compressing the raw Bitmap without cropping it to the visible screen area. Previously, extra logic was used to crop the image to the size of the WebView minus the scrollbar width, but this has been removed for a more straightforward approach.

- Refactored `addDownloadForAction` and `maybeStartDownload` to simplify logic and account for initialization and release states.
- Added `maybeRestartDownload` to handle download restarts.
- Adjusted conditional checks in `onDownloadStopped` to account for new remove and restart states.
- Simplified `Download` class by removing redundancy of action attribute and directly utilizing the action queue.
- Reworked `addAction` logic to handle actions correctly, now returning a boolean indicative of merge success.
- Updated `toString` in `Download` to reflect the state without assuming action type.

The change also includes implementation adjustments for confirming download idle state and restart operations to better align with the download flow.
```","Refactor DownloadManager to handle new action additions and streamline download states

This commit brings several improvements to the `DownloadManager` class. Changes include handling of new action additions, streamlining of download thread start logic, and clarification of download state transitions. Specifically, the commit:

- Removes redundant `maybeStartDownloads` calls by integrating download start checks into conditionals and initializations.
- Modifies the checking logic from `isStarted()` to `!isIdle()` to account for downloads that are not just started but also active.
- Simplifies the addition of new actions to existing downloads, relying on a boolean return value for the `addAction` method to indicate success.
- Eliminates commented code related to iterating and starting downloads, as the logic is now integrated into other methods.
- Introduces a new `maybeRestartDownload` method to handle the restart of downloads within the `Download` inner class.
- In the `Download` inner class, consolidates state change logic to harmonize with different possible actions and their outcomes.
- Refactors `addAction` for better clarity and logic flow, removing state checks and delegating state sets to a centralized `initialize` method.
- Simplifies the `onDownloadThreadStopped` method by configuring state transitions based on remaining actions and the final state of the download thread.

Overall, these changes aim to improve the consistency and readability of the download management process, while also better accommodating dynamic changes in download actions and states.","Use removing and restarting state internally in DownloadManager

By moving the ResourceManager creation code below the JobMaster REST endpoint start, the address is now passed to the ResourceManager upon its initialization.","[FLINK-8288] [runtime] register job master rest endpoint url to yarn

This commit introduces changes to the LLVMFrameDescriptors class to ensure that
all instruction blocks are visited, even if the program execution terminates
by calling 'exit()'. An 'unvisited' list keeps track of unprocessed blocks. 
The 'finish' method is added to process any remaining blocks, ensuring that
stack frame slot allocation is comprehensive, regardless of program termination

made to improve metadata handling. In MDLocation, 'scope' is now retrieved using
getNonNullable instead of getNullable to enforce its presence. In DIScopeExtractor, 
'MDVoidNode.INSTANCE' is now used instead of 'MDReference.VOID' to align with the 
singleton pattern for void metadata nodes.

"Refactor CrshAutoConfigurationTests to use generic ArrayList without type wildcard

Add evaluateForClass method to centralize condition evaluation in SpringBootCondition

Remove unused OnBeanCondition and related code from SpringSecurityOAuth2ResourceServerConfiguration

Change MySimpleUrlAuthenticationSuccessHandler constructor visibility from protected to public

Convert SecSecurityConfig from XML to Java config and extend WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter","feat: Improve Spring Security config and condition evaluations

This commit introduces several enhancements to the Spring-related configurations and conditions. 

For `CrshAutoConfigurationTests`, it simplifies the generic type declaration of `AccessDecisionVoter` instance creation by removing the wildcard bounds, promoting more straightforward and readable code.

In `SpringBootCondition`, it adds a new static method `evaluateForClass`, responsible for evaluating if a class with the `@Conditional` annotation should be loaded based on the specified `Condition` classes. The method utilizes `AnnotationUtils` and `BeanUtils` for reflection and instantiation of `Condition` objects.

The `SpringSecurityOAuth2ResourceServerConfiguration` class has been refactored to make use of the new `SpringBootCondition.evaluateForClass` for evaluating conditions. This change eliminates unnecessary direct instantiation of the `OnBeanCondition`, simplifying the condition evaluation code.

Additionally, the `SecSecurityConfig` class has been updated significantly. The class now extends `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`, properly configuring an in-memory authentication, a login page, a success handler, and CSRF protection. It uses Java-based configuration over XML configuration which was previously imported with `@ImportResource`, thus what was previously XML-based configuration has now been translated to Java Config providing a modern and type-safe approach to Spring Security configuration.

Lastly, `MySimpleUrlAuthenticationSuccessHandler` class constructor visibility has been changed from `protected` to `public`, allowing it to be more easily instantiated or extended outside of its package if needed. 

Summary: The commit encompasses refactoring of the security configuration using Java config over XML, simplifying generic types, and enhancing condition evaluation to align with the latest Spring frameworks best practices and features.","Here's a commit message for the described changes:

```
Refactor security configurations and simplify AccessDecisionVoter list

- Refactored CrshAutoConfigurationTests to simplify generic types in the AccessDecisionVoter list
- Enhanced SpringBootCondition with a new method, evaluateForClass, using additional Spring annotations to streamline condition evaluation
- Removed unnecessary imports and streamlined ResourceServerCondition in SpringSecurityOAuth2ResourceServerConfiguration to use SpringBootCondition.evaluateForClass
- Changed MySimpleUrlAuthenticationSuccessHandler constructor access modifier from protected to public to increase accessibility
- Replaced XML-based security configuration with Java-based configuration in SecSecurityConfig by extending WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter and adding necessary beans and methods

Add tests for resource retrieval with context class loader and null context loader in `ResourcesTest`","feat: Add context class loader support in Resources.getResource

Add support for using the context class loader to locate resources in the Resources class. This change allows resource retrieval in environments with different class loaders, such as application servers, ensuring the proper loader is used based on the current thread context. Additionally, test cases are added to verify the new functionality, ensuring that resources can be found when only visible to the context class loader, and handling cases when the context class loader is null.

BREAKING CHANGE: The method `Resources.getResource(String resourceName)` now uses the context class loader instead of the loader of the `Resources` class. This may affect existing usages where the context class loader has a different visibility than the `Resources` class's class loader.

refactor: optimize imports and handle 'java.home' property for font configuration

This commit optimizes various imports across JavaAWTSubstitutions and makes significant changes to the way font configurations are handled when the 'java.home' system property is null. The substitute method init() in Target_sun_font_FcFontConfiguration class has been reworked to prevent an error that used to be thrown if 'java.home' was null, which is a common case in native-image runtime environments. Additionally, the unnecessary property initialization of 'java.home' in SystemPropertiesSupport has been removed, as it was incongruent with the native-image environment where the concept of a JDK home is not applicable.

Furthermore, the logging level in RemoteWebDriver has been changed from info to fine for the ""Executing"" message, likely to reduce verbosity based on the context of the actual log usage.
```","For the JavaAWTSubstitutions changes:

```
Refactor JavaAWTSubstitutions to accommodate null java.home and import optimizations

This change reorders the imports to group native image imports together and moves AWT-related imports to the top. It substitutes methods in Target_sun_font_FcFontConfiguration and its related classes to ensure proper behavior when `java.home` is null, as can occur in a native-image context. Additionally, it extends support for the font configuration mechanics by introducing aliases and substitution methods for internal JDK behavior adjustment. This avoids potential errors when dealing with java.home during initialization and provides a tailored configuration for native images.

The changes also set java.home system property back to null instead of ""undefined"" avoiding incompatibilities with libraries checking for non-null values. This aligns the behavior with the expectation of a native-image environment where java.home may not be applicable.
```

For the SystemPropertiesSupport changes:

```
Remove java.home property initialization to align with native image expectations

The system property ""java.home"" initialization was removed to ensure consistency with the behavior expected in a native-image environment, where it can be set to null. This change stops the artificial setting of ""java.home"" to ""undefined"", thus respecting the native image's design decision.
```

For the RemoteWebDriver changes:

```
Lower log level for RemoteWebDriver command execution

Changed the log level of the command execution in RemoteWebDriver from info to fine, reducing verbosity and aligning with typical use-cases where info-level logging might be too high for successful command execution.

Refactor DynamicConfigurationFactory SPI default to 'nop'

This commit changes the default `DynamicConfigurationFactory` SPI implementation from ""file"" to ""nop"". This is in line with the 2.7.5 release notes which indicate a change in the default SPI implementation for this factory interface.

Optimize config getters and comparison checks in AbstractInterfaceConfig

Updated getter methods in `AbstractInterfaceConfig` to return early with instance fields if they are not null, reducing unnecessary calls to the config manager. Additionally, the `equals` method is now used for comparison of existing configs instead of comparing just their addresses. This aids in accurately checking for config equality.

Remove required flag from ModuleConfig name property

The `@Parameter` annotation in `ModuleConfig` has been modified by removing the `required = true` flag from the `getName()` method, suggesting a change in the handling of module names, possibly making it optional or managed elsewhere.

Cleanup ProtocolConfig and DubboBootstrap by removing unused refresh logic

Removed an empty `destroy` method from `ProtocolConfig` and refactored `getApplication`, `getMonitor`, `getMetrics`, `getModule`, and `getSsl` methods in `DubboBootstrap`. The refactoring ensures that the creation and refresh of configurations are properly managed, with `refresh` now called after setting new configs.

Explicitly invoke destroy in ReferenceConfigCache cleanup

In `ReferenceConfigCache`, added a call to `destroy` on `referenceConfig` when performing cleanup, ensuring that resources associated with the reference configurations are correctly released.

Change default ServiceDiscovery SPI implementation to 'zookeeper'

The default SPI implementation for `ServiceDiscovery` has been changed from ""file"" to ""zookeeper"", indicating a shift in preference or optimization for the service discovery mechanism.

Ensure InvokerInvocationHandler's ""$destroy"" returns null

Adjusted the `InvokerInvocationHandler` to return `null` for the `$destroy` method, conforming to expected behavior for void-returning interface methods when invoked via proxies.

Encapsulate PolyglotContextImpl's inner class state and provide accessors

Made `SingleContextState`'s fields `contextThreadLocal` and `singleContextAssumption` private and added accessors for them in `PolyglotContextImpl`. This encapsulation improves information hiding and class design while allowing controlled access to the required state.

Remove unnecessary locks in PolyglotEngineImpl

"Refactor patch method to handle 8, 16, 32, and 64-bit source sizes in AArch64MacroAssembler","feat(AArch64MacroAssembler): add support for 8 and 16 bit srcSize in patch method

BREAKING CHANGE: patch method now throws an assertion error for invalid srcSize values. Previously, it only handled 64 and 32 bit sizes.","Enhance timeout handling to prevent zero values and support positive integers

In this commit, we've made important improvements to the `IdleStateHandler`, `ReadTimeoutHandler`, and `WriteTimeoutHandler` classes. Specifically, we've implemented checks to ensure that the timeout values configured are strictly positive integers and that they correctly handle sub-millisecond time units. If a non-positive timeout is provided, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown to indicate an invalid argument. Additionally, we've adjusted the conversion to milliseconds to ensure that a minimal value of 1 millisecond is used if the provided timeout doesn't translate to zero milliseconds. This change prevents a scenario where a sub-millisecond timeout incorrectly rounds down to zero, which can cause undesirable behavior in timeout handlers.

For the `AArch64MacroAssembler` class, we've expanded the patch method to account for a wider range of `srcSize` values, including 8 and 16 bits, and added appropriate error handling for unexpected `srcSize` values. This enhancement ensures that the right shift size is calculated for different operand sizes, enhancing the assembler's versatility and correctness.

"Refactor CompactOperator to simplify atomic rename operation

Removed conditional logic for handling FileSystemKind.FILE_SYSTEM, as all file systems are now expected to support the copy bytes strategy for atomic renames.

refactor: remove FileSystemKind specific code in CompactOperator

The FileSystemKind specific code used to differentiate between FILE_SYSTEM and OBJECT_STORE has been removed from CompactOperator, simplifying the doAtomicRename function to always use the copy bytes method, which is optimized for object stores like S3 Filesystem. This change may affect compact operations on file systems that previously expected a rename operation.

Additionally, the unnecessary import for FileSystemKind has been removed, reflecting the codebase's move away from using this enum for conditional logic in file operations.

This commit addresses an issue in the ExtractTimestampsOperator where the current watermark could potentially move backwards. The variable has been renamed to `newWatermark` for clarity, and a condition has been updated to ensure that the current watermark is only updated when the new watermark is indeed greater than the current one. This fix helps maintain the contract that watermarks should be monotonically increasing.

Additionally, a new test has been added to verify that the timestamp extractor correctly handles scenarios where custom watermarks decrease. This test helps ensure that despite decreasing custom watermarks, the system does not emit watermarks that decrease over time.

Furthermore, the `CustomOperator` and `TimestampCheckingOperator` both now explicitly specify their chaining strategy as ALWAYS, ensuring their execution is optimized within the dataflow.

Remove filesystem kind check in CompactOperator atomic rename method

In this commit, the `doAtomicRename` method within `CompactOperator` has been simplified by removing the file system kind check and associated conditional logic. Previously, there was a distinction between handling renames for file systems (such as Hadoop FS) versus object stores (such as S3). The check for a file system kind and the branch for a file system-specific rename have been removed entirely, standardizing the rename mechanism to one that suits object stores but still works generically—essentially by copying the bytes to the new location. This simplification reflects a move towards a more uniform method of handling file renames that is agnostic to the underlying storage system.

The removal of the FileSystemKind import indicates a cleaning up of unused dependencies, further streamlining the code.","[FLINK-20665][connector-fs][table] FileNotFoundException when restore from latest Checkpoint in Sink Compaction

","Fixes Chip text padding & drawing.

The previous code was setting total padding (both start & end) as just end padding of the parent TextView and relying on the invalidation phase drawing the text in the correct place by shifting canvas with computed offset of start padding. This is risky as Chip may be just re-laid without actually invalidating it and render wrong paddings. Also RTL layout direction is incorrectly identified as LTR during layout sometimes, which makes the text being rendered with incorrect offset.

This change sets the paddings correctly removing the need of manual offsetting during onDraw() and relies purely on TextView for its text rendering.

fix: handle missing metadata during snapshot deletion

This commit fixes issues with handling snapshots when metadata is missing.
Snapshots are now deleted even if the metadata is absent, logging warnings
instead of failing the operation. Exception handling around shard deletion has
also been improved to prevent snapshot deletion failures due to shard-specific
errors.

- Catch `SnapshotException` and log warnings when reading snapshot metadata.
- Try-catch around shard data deletion to log warnings and continue with
  snapshot deletion despite shard deletion failures.
```

Note: The given code diff contained Java classes and changes relevant to Elasticsearch, particularly in how snapshot deletions were handled when metadata or shard information was missing. The commit message has been crafted based on the core changes applied to the Elasticsearch snapshot deletion logic.","Refactor TransportSuggestAction and related classes to utilize QueryShardContext

Summary of changes:
- Added QueryShardContext import and usage in various classes to simplify the interaction with shards and queries.
- Removed obsolete parameters and methods related to IndexFieldDataService and MapperService, replacing them with QueryShardContext.
- Simplified exception handling and added warnings for snapshot deletion failures.
- Extended test coverage for deleteSnapshotWithMissingMetadataTest method in snapshot restore tests.

This commit refactors the `SplitProcessor` class to use an `ArrayList` for storing the results of a string split operation instead of directly converting the array returned by `String.split()` to a list via `Arrays.asList()`. This change allows the list to be appendable, which is demonstrated by the new `SplitProcessorTests` that tests the combined use of `SplitProcessor` and `AppendProcessor` within a `CompoundProcessor`.

Additionally, a constructor overload is added to `InetSocketTransportAddress` to directly accept an `InetAddress` and a port, simplifying the creation of `InetSocketTransportAddress` instances. This is leveraged in `CloudZenPing` where `DiscoveryNode` instances are created using the new constructor, removing the need for intermediate `InetSocketAddress` creation.

Improvements:
- Switch to `ArrayList` for split results in `SplitProcessor` to enable list modification
- Add test in `SplitProcessorTests` to verify behavior of splitting and then appending

- Introduce default yellow level warning thresholds for disk space

To enhance the monitoring of disk space and to provide early warnings when the disk space is low, we've added two new constants `DEFAULT_DISK_YELLOW_LEVEL_IN_MB` and `DEFAULT_DISK_YELLOW_LEVEL_IN_BYTES` into `StatFsHelper`. These will allow the application to detect when the storage is reaching a predefined ""yellow"" warning level.

```","Allow HttpMsgConverter to depend on ConvService without creating a cycle

In an MVC web application, DelegatingWebMvcConfiguration provides the
ConversionService while also consuming WebMvcConfigurerAdapters that,
among other things, can configure HTTP message converters. Boot's
WebMvcConfigurerAdapter, WebMvcAutoConfigurationAdapter, consumes
the HttpMessageConverters bean and uses it to configure Spring MVC's
HTTP message converters. This can create a bean dependency cycle if
an HTTP message converter bean depends, directly or indirectly on
the ConversionService. An example of the cycle is:

┌─────┐
|  jsonComponentConversionServiceCycle.ThingDeserializer defined in …

|  org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.web.WebMvcAutoConfiguration$EnableWebMvcConfiguration
↑     ↓

This commit breaks the cycle by making WebMvcAutoConfigurationAdapter
consume HttpMessageConverters lazily. This allows the adapter to be
created without triggered instantiation of every HTTP message
converter bean and all their dependencies. This allows it to be
injected into DelegatingWebMvcConfiguration without triggering an
attempt to retrieve the ConversionService.

Optimize nested attribute array allocation and refine data filter update logic

This commit makes two changes to the ResultSetModel class:
1. When converting a list of nested attributes to an array, the allocation now uses a zero-length array to enable array size optimization by the JVM.
2. The updateDataFilter method now takes a boolean parameter 'metaChanged' to ensure accurate attribute constraint handling when visual positions differ. This accounts for the scenario where multiple columns with the same name exist in the result set.

Add description field to connection settings and fix connection name setting logic

1. A new text field 'descriptionText' has been added to allow users to enter a description for a database connection. The description field is populated when editing an existing connection.
2. The logic for setting the connection name now checks for nulls to prevent potential NullPointerExceptions.
3. When saving the connection settings, the description entered by the user is now saved along with the other configuration details.

Refactor variable and checks for default interface methods in ObjectKlass

This commit involves the following changes:
- In `Functions` and `FunctionsTest`, we replace deprecated `IOUtils.LINE_SEPARATOR` with `System.lineSeparator()` for better compatibility with Java standards.
- In `InterfaceTables`, we add an assertion to confirm that `thisInterfKlass` is an interface and mark a code block to be excluded from compilation with `CompilerAsserts.neverPartOfCompilation()`.
- We also refactor `ObjectKlass` by renaming `needsRecursiveInit` to `hasDeclaredDefaultMethods` to more accurately reflect its purpose. The related checks and methods are updated accordingly to use the new variable name. In addition, we add a private method `hasDeclaredDefaultMethods()` to encapsulate the check and assert logic, which helps to increase code readability and maintainability.

Add TLS support and refactor internal NetServer and NetClient tests

This commit introduces two significant changes to the NetTest Java class. First, it adds support for testing with Transport Layer Security (TLS) by creating separate test methods for secure connections. New tests `testNetServerInternalTLS` and `testNetClientInternalTLS` have been introduced, with the corresponding `testNetServerInternal_` and `testNetClientInternal_` helper methods being updated to accept `HttpClientOptions` and `HttpServerOptions` respectively.

Secondly, it refactors the existing `testNetServerInternal` and `testNetClientInternal` methods to utilize the new helper methods (`testNetServerInternal_` and `testNetClientInternal_`) with non-TLS options. This aids in avoiding code duplication by centralizing the common testing logic.

Additionally, an `import` line for `HttpClientOptions` was added to manage the client configuration for the tests.

For the CookieImplementationTest Java class, the commit adds two new test methods:

- `canHandleSecureCookie`: To verify that secure cookies can be handled correctly.
- `canHandleHttpOnlyCookie`: To ensure that HttpOnly cookies are properly managed.

The `testRetainsHttpOnlyFlag` test was updated with a missing `driver.get()` call that ensures the page is loaded before the cookie retrieval assertion.

A minor formatting change was also made to align with the codebase's style conventions by adjusting an error message in the `expiresOnBrowserRestart` test method.

These changes aim to extend the testing capabilities regarding cookies with `Secure` and `HttpOnly` attributes and to address testing for both SSL and non-SSL connections in the NetTest class.

- Move Extension annotation to DescriptorImpl for cleaner extension declaration

- Remove unnecessary constructor from Default provisioner

These changes aim to improve the extensibility of FileSystemProvisioner by defining DescriptorImpl subclasses which allow Jenkins to better manage these provisioner types.","Refactoring FileSystemProvisioner classes to enhance extensibility 

This commit refactors the FileSystemProvisioner classes by relocating the `@Extension` annotations from the `Default` nested classes to newly introduced `DescriptorImpl` nested classes within both the `FileSystemProvisioner` and `ZFSProvisioner` classes. Additionally, the `Default` constructor has been removed as it is no longer necessary.

By defining new `DescriptorImpl` classes, the commit enables Jenkins to utilize these as extension points for better extensibility and plugin support. The newly created descriptors include `discard` methods, which allow for workspace cleanup actions, and `getDisplayName` methods for a user-friendly representation of the provisioners.

The changes made are as follows:

For `FileSystemProvisioner.java`:
- Removed `@Extension` annotation and the redundant `Default` constructor from `Default` class.
- Added a new `DescriptorImpl` class as an inner class, with `@Extension` annotation and methods `discard` and `getDisplayName`.

For `ZFSProvisioner.java`:
- Added a new `DescriptorImpl` class as an inner class, with `@Extension` annotation and methods `discard` and `getDisplayName`.

With this refactoring, the code base promotes better encapsulation and follows Jenkins' conventions for defining extension points while setting the stage for future modifications or improvements, potentially preventing plugin compatibility issues.

`Http2Codec` checks for request body presence using the `HttpMethod` utility, which is not required since the same information can be obtained directly from the `Request` object.

Modifications:
- Remove the use of `HttpMethod.permitsRequestBody(request.method())` to determine if the request body is allowed.
- Directly check if `request.body()` is `null` to ascertain if a request body exists.

Result:
The `Http2Codec` class is simplified by removing an unnecessary utility method call, which also marginally improves performance.","Avoid sending empty HTTP/2 data frames when there is no request body.

- Refactor UI utility to maintain existing behavior with empty solution placeholder
- Add utility method for creating ordered lists of DB objects by name
- Ensure proper ordering of data source folders in connection page","Add background fix for read-only text fields and refactor ordering in DBUtils

The commit includes two main changes:

1. A fix has been applied to handle the background color of read-only text fields across UI components. While the functionality is not fully implemented (`fixReadonlyTextBackground` method has a section commented out due to an unresolved Eclipse bug), it lays the groundwork for future improvements.

2. The `DBUtils` class has been augmented with methods to create ordered lists of `DBPNamedObject`s from collections or arrays, ensuring consistency in object ordering throughout the application.

Code diff for UIUtils and GenericConnectionPage classes:
- A method `fixReadonlyTextBackground` is added to UIUtils to address read-only text styling.
- Use of `fixReadonlyTextBackground` in `GenericConnectionPage` has been modified, removing direct manipulation of the background color attribute which is no longer necessary.

Motivation:

The existing logic for expanding the `parameters` array in `PreparedStatementProxyImpl` might not appropriately handle the case where the old capacity is very low, potentially resulting in a `newCapacity` of 0 due to integer division by zero shift.

Modifications:

Adjusted the conditional check from `newCapacity == 0` to `newCapacity <= 4` ensuring a minimum capacity of 4. This change accounts for the situation where the old capacity is 1 or 2, avoiding an inadequate `newCapacity` after bitwise shifting.

- Remove redundant null checks, relying on query validation instead

This commit includes changes regarding query builders within a search functionality, specifically focusing on refining query validation and null handling. 

1. Remove redundant null checks across various query builders (`AndQueryBuilder`, `BoolQueryBuilder`, `BoostingQueryBuilder`, `ConstantScoreQueryBuilder`, `DisMaxQueryBuilder`, `FQueryFilterBuilder`, `FieldMaskingSpanQueryBuilder`, `NotQueryBuilder`, `OrQueryBuilder`, `QueryFilterBuilder`, `SpanNearQueryBuilder`) since validation methods have been adapted to handle null values.

4. The `PROTOTYPE` instances in `BoostingQueryBuilder`, `ConstantScoreQueryBuilder`, `FieldMaskingSpanQueryBuilder`, `FQueryFilterBuilder`, and `QueryFilterBuilder` have been simplified to avoid using a default no-argument constructor that could produce incomplete instances.

- Implement `toBigInteger(InetAddress address)` method in `InetAddresses` to obtain a `BigInteger` representation of an `InetAddress`.
- Implement `fromIpv4BigInteger(BigInteger address)` and `fromIpv6BigInteger(BigInteger address)` methods in `InetAddresses` to convert a `BigInteger` to an `Inet4Address` or `Inet6Address`, respectively.
- Add tests to ensure that IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are correctly converted to and from `BigInteger`, and throw appropriate exceptions when the `BigInteger` is out of the valid range.
- Amend IllegalArgumentException message to clarify constraints when a property count is too big for versions < 8 in `GraphProtocol`.
- Add detailed test methods in `GraphOutputTest` to check for correct behavior and handling of Int properties.

Remove unsupported setContinuousPlayback method from FakeAdsRequest.,"feat(EventFiringWebDriver): enable IME interaction by delegating to wrapped driver

refactor(FakeAdsRequest): remove unsupported setContinuousPlayback method","Here is the generated commit message for the first code diff:

```
Enable IME interaction support in EventFiringWebDriver

Previously, the EventFiringWebDriver class threw an UnsupportedOperationException when the ime() method was called, indicating that IME interactions were not supported. This commit changes the ime() method to return the IME handler from the driver's options, thereby enabling IME interaction support. Now, the EventFiringWebDriver correctly delegates the IME support to the wrapped driver instead of throwing an exception. This change aligns with the original intention of the WebDriver interface to support IME interactions where possible.

BREAKING CHANGE: The `--incompatible_disable_depset_in_cc_user_flags` has been removed. Previously deprecated usage of depset for `user_compile_flags` and `user_link_flags` in the C++ toolchain Starlark API is no longer allowed. 

Please update your Starlark code to pass user flags as lists instead of depsets.

This commit is a refactoring action that eliminates the support for passing depsets into user-defined C++ compilation and linking flags. Updating the C++ toolchain Starlark API, this change forces the use of lists instead of depsets for specifying user compile and link flags. It aligns with the goal of simplifying the build API and improving performance by discouraging the use of depsets where they are not necessary.

The following adjustments have been made:
1. Removal of `disableDepsetInUserFlags` option from `CppOptions` and its references across the codebase.
2. The `userFlagsToIterable` method in the `CcModule` is refactored to only accept `SkylarkList`.
3. Affected test cases in `SkylarkCcCommonTest` are updated to reflect this change.
4. Deprecated depset-related functionality is removed from `CcModuleApi` interface.

"Add detailed state inspection methods to various `Subject` implementations

- Implement methods to assess the current state of subjects: `hasValue`, `hasThrowable`, `hasCompleted`, `getValue`, `getThrowable`
- Add documentation to clarify the purpose and usage of newly added state inspection methods
- Expand unit tests to cover the new state inspection logic for subjects
- Address potential consistency issues with the `size` method in concurrent scenarios
- Enhance testing reliability by specifying a timeout for concurrency tests
- Add comments to clarify code intent in `ReplaySubject`
- Introduce internal array utility method for copying values in `ReplaySubject`
- Provide additional test coverage for the notification lite and ensure correct event kind identification","feat: add tests for multiple subjects and enhance comment documentation

New test cases have been added for `AsyncSubject`, `BehaviorSubject`, `PublishSubject`, `ReplaySubject`, and `NotificationLiteTest` to ensure correct behavior across various states and scenarios (including concurrency concerns).

Additionally, comment documentation has been enhanced across subjects to clarify the behavior and expectations of methods. This includes new annotations for class visibility conditions, subscriber event handling, and `NotificationLite` behavior. 

The `ReplaySubjectTest` includes an upgrade to the test infrastructure with the introduction of a `TestScheduler`, which allows time-based testing for replay subjects.

The `OperatorMergeTest` also had a timeout added to prevent potential infinite waiting during concurrency tests. 

A minor refactoring is visible in the `ReplaySubject` where index release comments have been added, and eviction policy has been updated to ensure that final values are correctly retained.

Furthermore, the `ReplaySubjectConcurrencyTest` and `ReplaySubjectBoundedConcurrencyTest` classes have also been updated to test new conditions that could arise during concurrent operations.

Please note that these changes increase the reliability and maintainability of the `rx.subjects` package's subject classes by providing better visibility into their inner workings and ensuring their robustness through expanded testing.","Add Subscriber state checks and value retrieval methods to various Subjects

This commit introduces new helper methods across multiple `Subject` classes, providing additional ways to check the state of a `Subject` (such as whether it has values, has completed normally or with an exception) and to retrieve the current values it holds.

Notably:
- Added state-checking methods to `AsyncSubject`, `BehaviorSubject`, `PublishSubject`, and `ReplaySubject`.
- Added value retrieval methods to `ReplaySubject`.
- Implemented size and hasAnyValue tests for ReplaySubjects.
- Improved test coverage for `NotificationLite` to handle various types of notifications.
- Fixed a potential issue with `OperatorMergeTest` by adding a timeout to the `testConcurrency` method.

The new methods enhance the querying abilities of the `Subject` variants, providing thread-safe ways to inspect their states, particularly useful for use-cases involving concurrent access or snapshot state retrieval.

- `hasValue()`: returns `true` if the `Subject` holds a value that can be retrieved.
- `getValue()`: retrieves the current value if present.
- `hasCompleted()`: returns `true` if the `Subject` has completed normally.
- `hasThrowable()`: returns `true` if the `Subject` has terminated with an error.
- `getThrowable()`: retrieves the `Throwable` that caused termination.
- `size()`: returns the number of buffered non-terminal events.
- `hasAnyValue()`: reports whether at least one non-terminal event is available for replay.
- `getValues()`: returns a snapshot of the currently buffered non-terminal events.
- `getValues(T[] a)`: similar to `getValues()` but allows filling an existing array.

These capabilities allow for improved introspection of subject state, particularly in multi-threaded environments where consistent state is crucial.

- disappear into additional flag inputs (expansion flags)

"Add target buffer size control to HlsChunkSource

A new field for target buffer size (in bytes) has been added to `HlsChunkSource` to complement the existing target buffer duration used for adaptive streaming. This change also includes the necessary checks to ensure that the buffer does not exceed the defined size. By adding `DEFAULT_TARGET_BUFFER_SIZE` and passing `targetBufferSize` into the `HlsChunkSource` constructor, users can now specify a maximum buffer size threshold along with the previously available duration-based threshold. This gives more fine-grained control over the memory footprint of the chunk source, making it possible to prevent excessive buffering of data while still allowing for a seamless streaming experience.","feat: Add target buffer size control to HlsChunkSource

The HlsChunkSource is now capable of limiting the amount of data buffered by a target buffer size, in addition to the existing time-based duration control. This additional constraint ensures that the buffer does not grow indefinitely and respects memory usage constraints, providing a limit to how much data will be buffered ahead of the playback position in terms of bytes.

This commit introduces the `DEFAULT_TARGET_BUFFER_SIZE` constant, sets a default buffer size, and updates the `HlsChunkSource` constructors to accept the target buffer size parameter. It modifies the `getChunkOperation` method to consider the target buffer size before deciding whether to return the next chunk or halt further fetching, providing both time and size-based buffering strategies.

This enhancement aids in more sophisticated adaptation logic and resource management, particularly for environments with strict memory usage limitations.","Add target buffer size control in HlsChunkSource.

This commit introduces `DEFAULT_TARGET_BUFFER_SIZE` as a default target buffer size and incorporates it into the `HlsChunkSource` constructor. The buffer size check is also added to the `getChunkOperation` method to ensure that the buffer will not exceed the allocated size by more than one chunk. This update allows better control over the memory consumption of the buffer based on its size in bytes, in addition to its duration.

- Add `DEFAULT_TARGET_BUFFER_SIZE` constant for default buffer size in bytes.
- Include `targetBufferSize` parameter in `HlsChunkSource` constructors.

when I download some images with media variations feature enabled, then I got some entries written to the media variations index database, but if I cleared all the previous cached  images (or load the same image while writing index info to the db) , and reload those images again, I would got duplicate entries with the same mediaId, width, height and resourceId pointing to the same disk cache key

**reproduce steps** :
0. check out current master branch
1.  just run example/media-variations
2. click to load all the images
3. then click the ""Clear cache and reset"" menu
4. reload all those images again
5. repeat step 3 and 4 if you want
6. pull the media-variations index database from the test device, open it using a sqlite3 client and query all entries from media_variations_index table
7. ***observable result*** : you would find more than one entries with identical mediaId, width, height, resourceId, cache_key and resource_id (except the auto generated primary key)

**Test plan*

"Refactor DBGBaseSession to centralize breakpoint management and lock handling

Author: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>

Refactor the DBGBaseSession class to move the breakpoint list and corresponding add/remove methods into the base class. Lock handling for shared and exclusive access has been centralized into separate methods to reduce code duplication across methods that need to manipulate session state. Additionally, execute the abort command asynchronously to ensure consistency in session handling.

Closes #4321 from feature/centralize-breakpoint-management

Simplify PostgreDebugSession by leveraging the DBGBaseSession's implementation

Author: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>

Remove direct breakpoint and lock handling from PostgreDebugSession and use the newly refactored methods in DBGBaseSession. By delegating to the base class, we maintain cleaner code and a single source of truth for session and breakpoint management. This change also improves the overall maintainability and readability of the debug session handling for PostgreSQL.

feat(ProducerBatch): implement atomic final state for batches and enhance abort logic

This commit refactors `ProducerBatch` to use an atomic reference for its final state, ensuring that batch abortion and completion follow a strict lifecycle. A new enum `FinalState` defines possible end states. Changes include the addition of `abort` methods to handle exceptions and guard against state inconsistencies. The `RecordAccumulator` has been updated to use the new `abortRecordAppends` method before removing batches, maintaining lock safety and correct state transitions.

Additionally, `ProducerBatchTest` has been extended with tests to verify the new behavior, ensuring that batches cannot be aborted or completed multiple times and that subsequent completions after an abort are ignored.

refactor(DBGBaseSession, PostgreDebugSession): improve debug session operation and breakpoint handling

These changes provide a refactoring in `DBGBaseSession` and `PostgreDebugSession` to streamline the session's lifecycle and breakpoint management operations. The commit moves breakpoint-specific methods to `PostgreDebugSession`, adds list management in `DBGBaseSession`, and refines the lock acquisition process.

Refactor ProducerBatch to use AtomicReference for final state tracking

This commit enhances the ProducerBatch final state management by replacing
the AtomicBoolean 'completed' with an AtomicReference 'finalState', which keeps
track of the batch's final state (ABORTED, FAILED, SUCCEEDED). It also makes sure
that once a batch has been aborted, subsequent calls to 'done' have no effect. New
methods 'abort' and 'abortRecordAppends' are introduced for explicitly handling batch
abortions, and the 'abort' method is now used in RecordAccumulator for abandoning
batches. Additionally, this commit adds related unit test cases to ProducerBatchTest to
validate the new behavior.

refactor: remove RemoteRetrier class in favor of retryScheduler

Replace RemoteRetrier class with the use of ListeningScheduledExecutorService directly to
manage retry logic within remote execution components. Simplify RemoteSpawnRunner by integrating
retriable exception check logic and utilizing a new Retrier implementation.

BREAKING CHANGE: RemoteRetrier class is removed and replaced by retry scheduling logic within the RemoteSpawnRunner class. Third-party code depending on the RemoteRetrier will need to adapt to the new approach.
```","Optimize Remote Execution by removing redundant hostname lookups and refactoring retrial logic

The changes primarily involve optimization of hostname lookups and refactoring of retrial logic in the context of Bazel's remote execution modules:

1. Cached hostname to prevent redundant lookups: `BazelWorkspaceStatusModule` now accepts `hostname` as a parameter instead of redundant lookups on every build. The hostname caching logic is added in a private method `getHostname()` which uses `NetUtil.findShortHostName()` only once, avoiding expensive DNS lookups.

2. Removed deprecated retrier: Refactored the retrial logic by replacing the `RemoteRetrier` with `ListeningScheduledExecutorService` and moving the generic retrial logic into the `RemoteSpawnRunner`. Also, removed deprecated classes and methods linked with the removed retrier, simplifying the exception handling.

3. Managed remote action context: `RemoteActionContextProvider` was updated to use the new retry scheduler. The implementation ensures that remote actions are correctly retried within the scheduling context.

4. Unified retriable exception checks: A common method `retriableExecErrors` is introduced in `RemoteSpawnRunner` to consolidate the checks for retriable execution errors.

The commit removes unnecessary complexity and improves maintainability, and also potentially increases the performance of null builds by avoiding repetitive hostname resolution.

Commit message:
``` 
Optimize hostname lookup caching and refactor retries for remote execution

- Cache the system hostname lookups within BazelWorkspaceStatusModule
- Replace RemoteRetrier with ListeningScheduledExecutorService and inline retrial logic
- Remove unnecessary exception handling logic and imports
- Centralize checks for retriable remote execution errors within the RemoteSpawnRunner class

This change aims to enhance performance, especially for null builds, by caching the hostname across builds and simplifying remote execution retry mechanisms for better maintainability and efficiency.

Netty always accumulates the header fragments into a single buffer before attempting to HPACK decode process and so keeping state and delaying notification that bounds have been exceeded is not necessary.

Modifications:
- HPACK Decoder#decode(..) now must be called with a complete header block
- HPACK will terminate immediately if the maximum header length, or maximum number of headers is exceeded
- Reduce member variables in the HPACK Decoder class because they can now live in the decode(..) method

Result:
HPACK bounds checking is done earlier and less class state is needed."

Add tests and exception handling for property counts in GraphOutput

This commit introduces two new tests in `GraphOutputTest` that check the behavior of the application when handling integer properties. The `testIntPropertiesFailWithOldVersion` verifies that an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown when the property count exceeds the limit for protocols with a major version less than 8. The `testIntPropertiesWithDefaultVersion` ensures that the correct property count is processed with the default protocol version. It also includes the import of two new packages, `java.nio.charset.Charset` and `java.util.HashMap`, to assist in the tests.

Furthermore, the commit includes an update to `GraphProtocol` where the exception thrown in case of a too-large property count is changed from `IOException` to `IllegalArgumentException`. The exception message now also advises that a property count is only valid for versions less than 8 if it's smaller than `Character.MAX_VALUE - 1`.

Commit Message:
```

Summary:
Removed the total progress tracking from ProgressivePromise and related classes. Now the progress and total are passed explicitly to the listeners, aligning with how futures work in Netty.

Changes:
- Removed `total` tracking from `ProgressivePromise` and `DefaultProgressivePromise`.
- Modified `setProgress` and `tryProgress` signatures to take both `progress` and `total` arguments explicitly.
- Updated implementations and usages of `ProgressivePromise` to adapt to the new signature change.
- Simplified progress reporting in various Channel implementations to pass progress and total directly.

Impact:
Listeners that handle progress must expect to receive both the current progress and the total now, rather than relying on the `total()` method in `ProgressiveFuture`.

Note:
- Ensured the use of `newProgressivePromise()` is consistent across the codebase.
- Tests and documentation should be updated accordingly to match the new behavior.
- It is recommended to verify external usages of `ProgressivePromise` and make necessary adjustments.","Use progress + total instead of delta

This change is designed to simplify the management of layers during the jar packaging process, improving efficiency and maintainability.

Refs #27489","Prevent duplicate jar entries from being written

Update the `AbstractJarWriter` so that it can directly build the layer
index as entries are written. Prior to this commit, a layer tracking
was handled by a decorator class which was broken because it didn't
override enough methods. Since `AbstractJarWriter` has quite a complex
API, it seems sensible to have it handle the layer index directly,
removing the need for a decorator entirely.

refactor: refactor serializers and deserializers in Gson for better hierarchy support

This refactoring improves how the Gson library handles serializers and deserializers by introducing specific methods and maps for hierarchy types. This change allows for better organization and easier maintenance when handling types in a hierarchy, improving the overall functionality of serialization and deserialization components.
```","Refactor DefaultTypeAdapters to separate type hierarchy serializers and deserializers

This commit refactors the `DefaultTypeAdapters` class to separate serializers and deserializers for type hierarchies into distinct maps. Two new static final maps `DEFAULT_HIERARCHY_SERIALIZERS` and `DEFAULT_HIERARCHY_DESERIALIZERS` are created to handle type hierarchy serialization and deserialization, respectively. Additionally, new `getAllDefaultSerializers()` and `getAllDefaultDeserializers()` methods are added to this class to provide a combined view of both default and hierarchy serializers/deserializers.

Related changes are also made in the `Gson` and `GsonBuilder` classes to leverage the newly isolated hierarchy adapters. In the `ParameterizedTypeHandlerMap`, a new method `register(ParameterizedTypeHandlerMap<T> other)` is introduced to provide the ability to combine adapter maps more easily.

Moreover, in the `EnumTest` class, the `testEnumSubclassWithRegisteredTypeAdapter` test case is restored and modified to assert the custom serialization/deserialization of enum types with a registered type adapter.

Lastly, updates are made to the `DefaultHomeFinder` and `GraalVMLocator` classes to replace `Boolean.valueOf` with `Boolean.parseBoolean` when reading system environment/property variables, resulting in a more concise syntax that avoids unnecessary boxing.

All these changes collectively enhance the structure and maintainability of type handling within the codebase and fix unnecessary boxing with the simplified boolean parsing method.

Summary of changes:

- Refactored `DefaultTypeAdapters` to cleanly separate hierarchy-aware serializers and deserializers.
- Introduced combined retrieval methods for all serializers and deserializers.
- Updated `Gson` and `GsonBuilder` constructors to use the new retrieval methods.
- Added a method in `ParameterizedTypeHandlerMap` to simplify registration from another map.
- Removed redundant type registration in `DefaultTypeAdapters` due to added hierarchy-aware maps.
- Corrected parsing of boolean system properties in `DefaultHomeFinder` and `GraalVMLocator`.
- Restored a test case in `EnumTest` to cover custom type adapters for subclasses of enums.","Registering default type hierarchy adapters first and allow users to override them.

```","Refactor and enhance FactoryBean type resolution logic; enable test for SPR-15125

This commit encompasses two main changes:
1. The refactoring of the `getTypeForFactoryBean` logic in `AbstractAutowireCapableBeanFactory` to streamline the process of factory method introspection and type-resolution for `FactoryBean` instances. A new private method `getTypeForFactoryBeanFromMethod` is created to handle the common logic, which is now utilized in multiple parts of the code.
2. The re-enabling and extension of JUnit tests in `AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessorTests` that verify the correct self-injection of `FactoryBean` instances.

"Implement automatic handling of HTTP/1.1 100 Continue response

Motivation:

To comply with the HTTP/1.1 specification, servers should, upon receiving an `Expect: 100-continue` header, either send a `100 Continue` status to indicate that the client should continue to send the request body, or reject the request with an appropriate error status code.

Modifications:

- Added support for automatic handling of `Expect: 100-continue` header in `Http2ServerResponseImpl`.
- Refined the creation of `VertxHttp2Handler` objects to respect the new server option `handle100ContinueAutomatically`.
- Updated `VertxHttp2Handler` to support manual and automatic response to `Expect: 100-continue`.
- Refactored configuration logic in `VertxHttp2HandlerBuilder` to include the `HttpServerOptions` directly instead of individual option fields.
- Extended tests to cover scenarios including manual rejection, automatic handling, and absence of `Expect: 100-continue` header.

Result:

The server can now automatically send a `100 Continue` response when expected by the client, conforming to HTTP/1.1 protocol requirements, and client code can correctly handle the continuation or rejection of a request based on the server's response.","feat: add support for HTTP/2 100-Continue automatic handling

Motivation:

HTTP/2 clients may wait for a 100 (Continue) response before sending the request body. Implementing automatic handling of the 100-continue expectation improves usability and compatibility with HTTP/2 clients expecting this feature.

Modifications:

- Implement `writeContinue` method in `Http2ServerResponseImpl` to send a 100-continue response when requested.
- Update `HttpServerImpl` to use `HttpServerOptions` when adding the `VertxHttp2Handler` to the pipeline.
- Change `VertxHttp2Handler` to handle the 100-continue expectation automatically based on server options, by sending the 100-continue response when detected in headers.
- Update `VertxHttp2HandlerBuilder` to receive `HttpServerOptions` instead of a specific flag for compression to configure the handler properly.
- Add tests in `Http2Test` to check both manual and automatic 100-continue handling, as well as rejection by setting a different status code.

Result:

Servers can now automatically handle HTTP/2 100-continue expectations based on the `handle100ContinueAutomatically` option in `HttpServerOptions`. Manual handling and rejection of the expectation is also tested.","Implement HTTP/1.1 100 Continue support in HTTP/2 server response

Motivation:

Previous code base did not handle the HTTP/1.1 100 Continue response properly in the HTTP/2 implementation. This behavior is important to handle client expectations for continuation or rejection of the request body transmission.

Modifications:

- `Http2ServerResponseImpl` now writes a CONTINUE (100 status code) response when `writeContinue()` is called.
- `VertxHttp2Handler` checks for the `Expect: 100-continue` header in the incoming request and sends a 100 Continue response if `HttpServerOptions` is configured to handle 100 Continue automatically.
- `VertxHttp2HandlerBuilder` now receives `HttpServerOptions` instead of a `supportsCompression` boolean to allow access to server options.
- Updated the `Http2Test` to include testing logic for both automatically and manually handled 100 Continue responses as well as a rejection case using a 405 status code.

Result:

1. For `DefaultReportBucketManager` changes:

```
refactor(report-bucket): optimize deletion check with validPaths set

Replace direct date comparison with a HashSet validPaths to manage valid dates for report retention. The queryValidPath method generates valid paths for a given range of days, enhancing the maintainability and readability of the shouldDeleteReport method.
```

2. For `ResourceArrayPropertyEditor` changes:

```
refactor(resource-editor): switch from List to Set for resource deduplication

Change the internal resource collection from List to Set to avoid manual deduplication and improve performance. The code now uses the inherent capabilities of a HashSet to manage unique resources, simplifying the setValue method's logic.
```","For the first code diff:

```
Refactor report deletion logic to use Set for valid path comparison
```

Explanation: The diff indicates refactoring in the report deletion logic. Instead of two fixed dates (""today"" and ""week""), a `Set<String>` called `validPaths` is now used to determine if a path should be retained. The `queryValidPath` function generates valid paths based on the current time and the given number of days.

For the second code diff:

```
Optimize ResourceArrayPropertyEditor to prevent duplicate resources
```

Explanation: This diff shows a change from using a `List<Resource>` to `Set<Resource>` in the `ResourceArrayPropertyEditor` to store merged resources. This inherently removes duplicates by virtue of the `Set` properties and simplifies the code by removing explicit duplicate checks and replacing multiple `add` calls with `addAll` for adding arrays of resources.","Optimization in ResourceArrayPropertyEditor

- Adjusted methods in HlsPlaylistTracker to accept Uri instead of HlsUrl
- Streamlined media playlist URL collection into HlsMasterPlaylist's mediaPlaylistUrls
- Simplified DefaultHlsPlaylistTracker's MediaPlaylistBundle to store playlist as Uri
- Updated all relevant method calls and corresponding documentations to match the new structure

These changes provide clarity by reducing unnecessary subclassing and using standard Uri where applicable.","feat: streamline HLS playlist classes and parsing

Refactor HLS playlist classes by introducing `Variant` for stream-inf parsing and replacing `HlsUrl` with `Uri` across classes. This simplifies data structures, and improves handling of media playlist URLs for master playlist parsing and HLS downloader functionality. Fix `PlaylistResetException` and `PlaylistStuckException` handling and update master playlist parser test to reflect changes.","Refactor Hls* classes to use Uri instead of HlsUrl and remove HlsUrl class.

Refactored various HLS-related classes to use `Uri` directly instead of the now-removed `HlsUrl` class. The `HlsUrl` class has been replaced by `HlsMasterPlaylist.Variant` and other inner classes where appropriate. Additionally, modified collection handling to ensure deduplication and proper list construction for media playlist URLs.

Also included updates to parsing logic to handle variable substitution within playlists, ensuring proper interpretation of URLs and respecting nested references that shouldn't be resolved.

Here is a summary of the primary changes made across the files:
- Removed `HlsUrl` class usage and references.
- Introduced `mediaPlaylistUrls` field in `HlsMasterPlaylist`.
- Modified method signatures to use `Uri` directly.
- Refactored various methods to correctly process and construct lists of unique media playlist URLs.

In addition to these changes, fixes were applied to prevent potential bugs relating to stream position calculations when handling retries for chunk loading. The `ExtractorInput` now utilizes the loading position rather than the original stream position, addressing an issue with incorrect chunk index offsets during retries. The `init()` method on the extractor is now only called if no bytes were previously loaded to maintain the correct state across retries.","Remove HlsUrl and introduce HlsMasterPlaylist.mediaPlaylistUrls

- This removes the need for Variant and Rendition to have a common
  base class, allowing the url field to be marked as @Nullable in
  Rendition but not in Variant.
- The addition of mediaPlaylistUrls is needed for the new StreamKey
  indexing for HLS. It's also convenient in a couple of places (e.g.
  HlsDownloader), where a list of all media playlist URLs is needed.
- Lots of places where HlsUrl was passed only needed the actual
  URL (not the Format, which is the other piece of HlsUrl). Passing
  just the URL is a little simpler, and resolves some of the naming
  confusion.

refactor: rename needsRecursiveInit to hasDeclaredDefaultMethods in ObjectKlass

This commit renames the boolean field `needsRecursiveInit` in the ObjectKlass class to `hasDeclaredDefaultMethods` to better reflect its purpose. It also adds a method `hasDeclaredDefaultMethods()` to check the condition referencing the renamed field, ensuring consistency. Additionally, an assertion is added in the InterfaceTables class to verify that the klass is an interface before proceeding with its construction. The CompilerAsserts.neverPartOfCompilation() call is added to indicate that the code shouldn't be compiled as part of the Truffle compilation roots.

feat: improve type resolution in ReflectingFieldNavigator

In ReflectingFieldNavigator, a new method `getMoreSpecificType` is introduced to resolve the type of fields in a more specific manner. This approach uses the actual object instance to infer the type, providing better handling for generic fields that may not be able to be fully resolved at compile-time. This enhances Gson's ability to serialize and deserialize fields correctly when working with type variables or when the declared type is Object.class.

test: ensure raw serialization correctness in RawSerializationTest

The unit test `testParameterizedObject` in RawSerializationTest has been updated to remove a try-catch block aimed at capturing AssertionFailedError. The test now directly compares the serialization output of the `Bar<Foo>` object to the expected JSON both with and without explicitly specifying the type. The commit message implies that the Gson serialization process is expected to work regardless of whether the type is explicitly specified, preserving the consistency and correctness of the raw serialization functionality.

Additionally, fix button text assignment in `Button` class

The `Button` class has been updated to simplify the `setText` method.

The `FreeTypeFontGenerator` has been adjusted to account for the `shadowOffsetY` when calculating the cap height of the font. This change ensures that the shadow effect does not clip or overlap with the text, maintaining the intended visual quality of the font's appearance.

**Commit message:**

```plaintext
Refactor emitter position logic and improve editor property panels

- Use worldCamera viewport dimensions for emitter positioning in EffectPanel.
- Streamline button text assignment in Button class.
- Introduce editRowsPanel and adjust property panels in ParticleEditor.
- Increase precision of spawn size calculations in ParticleEmitter by using float data types.
- Include shadow offset in cap height calculation in FreeTypeFontGenerator.

```

This commit message summarizes multiple changes across different classes, providing a clear context for each change while following the conventional structure of commit messages.","[freetype] Include shadow size in cap height.

The AngleCode font format stores only ""base"", which is capHeight + ascent. The capHeight is not stored, instead it is gotten from a glyph height. A bitmap font's glyph height includes shadow, so the FreeType font's capHeight must also. The achieved goal is identical rendering of a FreeType font and that same font turned into a bitmap font using BitmapFontWriter."
Add support for filtering tests based on 'onlyrun' and 'method' system properties,"feat(TestIgnorance): Add filtering tests via system properties

This change enables specifying particular tests or methods to run via system properties.","Add filtering test execution based on environment variables

In this commit, functionality was added to filter which tests are executed based on environment variables. Now, tests can be selectively run by specifying their names in the `onlyrun` or `method` system properties. This feature will allow for more fine-grained control over the test execution process, making it easier to run subsets of the test suite as needed for focused testing or debugging.

- Added imports for `Sets` from Guava and `Arrays` from `java.util`.
- Introduced two new `Set<String>` collections: `methods` to store specific test methods and `only` to store names of test classes.
- Updated the `TestIgnorance` constructor to parse and initialize these collections based on the `onlyrun` and `method` system properties.
- Added a new method `isIgnoredDueToEnvironmentVariables` that checks if a test or method is ignored based on the newly parsed environment variables.

This change enhances test execution flexibility by allowing the inclusion or exclusion of tests dynamically, depending on the specified environment variables.","SimonStewart: Restoring the ability to filter tests by onlyrun and method system properties

allowed to be deleted.

THe locking mechanism is implemented via ephemeral child nodes of the respective
ZooKeeper node. Whenever a ZooKeeperStateHandleStore wants to lock a ZNode, thus,
protecting it from being deleted, it creates an ephemeral child node. The node's
name is unique to the ZooKeeperStateHandleStore instance. The delete operations
will then only delete the node if it does not have any children associated.

Refactor the DownloadManagerTest to use a direct listener setup for monitoring download tasks, improving test code maintainability and readability. The changes involve replacing the previously used ConditionVariable with a dedicated TestDownloadListener that encapsulates state synchronization and error handling logic.

- Remove unused variables downloadFinishedCondition and downloadError.
- Integrate TestDownloadListener instantiation directly into test setup.
- Replace old condition variable blocking mechanism with the listener's new blocking method.

The updated test structure provides more intuitive control over asynchronous operations and centralized error handling, leading to more robust and clear testing outcomes for DownloadManager functionalities.","Title: Refactor DownloadManagerTest to use TestDownloadListener for task completion synchronization

Changes:
- Removed the usage of downloadFinishedCondition and downloadError directly in the test methods.
- Replaced the direct listener setup with the instance of the newly created TestDownloadListener.
- Encapsulated ConditionVariable and Throwable handling within the TestDownloadListener class providing a method to block until tasks are complete and throw any captured download errors.
- Updated test methods to use the new blockUntilTasksCompleteAndThrowAnyDownloadError method from TestDownloadListener for synchronization purposes.

The refactor improves the test class's design by centralizing the handling of task completion and error throwing within the TestDownloadListener and simplifying the test method implementations.

# Developer Notes
The commit adds a cleaner and more centralized approach to handling download task completion and errors within the DownloadManagerTest. This makes the tests easier to read and maintain while encapsulating synchronization logic within the listener.

# Test Plan
Ensure that all affected unit tests in DownloadManagerTest pass without issues, and no regressions are introduced by this change.","Simplify DownloadService by removing broadcasting

Refactor Java binary launcher handling to support stripped and unstripped artifacts,"feat: support producing both stripped and unstripped Java binaries

This commit modifies the Java binary build process to support producing both stripped and unstripped Java binaries, allowing for better integration with other build rules that may require unstripped outputs. Changes include updating `JavaBinary` and `JavaSemantics` interfaces and implementations to handle a pair of launcher artifacts representing the stripped and unstripped variants. The `BazelJavaSemantics` is also adapted to return the pair as required.","Refactor JavaBinary and JavaSemantics to use Pair for launcher artifacts

This commit refactors the `JavaBinary` and `JavaSemantics` classes to make use of a `Pair` object for representing the launcher and unstripped launcher artifacts. Additionally, it introduces the `unstrippedDeployArchiveBuilder` parameter to handle cases where binaries should not be stripped.

- Introduce `Pair<Artifact, Artifact>` type to return launcher and unstripped launcher from `JavaSemantics.getLauncher`.
- Pass `unstrippedDeployArchiveBuilder` into `JavaSemantics.getLauncher` and update `JavaBinary` accordingly.
- Adapt `JavaBinary` constructor to handle the new Pair return type and use it to set launcher artifacts.

These changes facilitate better handling of stripped and unstripped binaries, aligning with configuration options that determine whether stripping should occur.","Set up only one link action for JavaBinary launcher with fission

Original description:
Change getLauncher to return both a stripped and unstripped launcher binary
artifact under fission, instead of invoking getLauncher twice. This was
setting up two identical link actions that required later work to filter
out the redundant action in filterSharedActionsAndThrowActionConflict.
This becomes extremely inefficient under ThinLTO, where each launcher link
is actually 1 LTO indexing action, N LTO Backend actions, and 1 native link
action.

Additionally, an internal test suite is created using Robolectric to verify the behavior of observable streams bound to both native and support library fragments.

References #35, Closes #42","Adding CRC32 checksum to CompressedXContent for fast equality checks

This commit improves the performance of the `CompressedXContent.equals` method by incorporating a CRC32 checksum. This checksum is computed for the uncompressed data and stored along with the compressed data, allowing `equals` to perform a fast checksum comparison before potentially more costly decompression steps. Additional constructor overloads and helper methods were added to facilitate the creation of `CompressedXContent` with the checksum included. The `hashCode` method now relies on the CRC32 checksum for consistency and speed. Serialization methods `readCompressedString` and `writeTo` have been updated to handle the new checksum field.

Additionally, the commit simplifies the `DocumentMapper.refreshSource()` method by directly creating `CompressedXContent` with the high-level `ToXContent` pipeline, which now incorporates checksum handling.

refactor: remove CloseNotifyListener from SslHandler for simplification

Motivation:

The CloseNotifyListener in SslHandler was used to track the state of SSL
close_notify message handling but added unnecessary complexity without
providing tangible benefits. This led to confusion and harder-to-maintain
code.

Modifications:

- Removed CloseNotifyListener class and related code.
- Simplified the SslHandler exception handling in the event of an SSL
  closeInbound() call.
- Cleaned up the future listeners to avoid tracking close_notify write 
  completion state.
- Streamlined the write method signature by removing the redundant throws 
  clause.
- Made minor optimizations in unwrap() loop iteration and local variable 
  management.

Result:

The SslHandler class is simplified, removing unnecessary code regarding the
handling of the SSL close_notify state, resulting in cleaner and more
maintainable code.
```","Remove unused CloseNotifyListener and improve SslHandler logic

Motivation:

The CloseNotifyListener within SslHandler was never used, which could lead to confusion and unnecessary code maintenance. The current implementation also had some inefficiencies and unclear catches for SSLException during inbound closure.

Modifications:

- Removed the unused CloseNotifyListener class.
- Removed the listener attachment from `closeOutbound()`.
- Refactored the `unwrap()` method to pre-calculate the size of the output list to avoid checking the size in each loop iteration.
- Simplified the SSLException catching logic during closure of inbound to only log relevant warnings.
- Removed unnecessary variables and checks related to `ClosedChannelException`.
- Removed the listener from the `closeNotifyFuture` as it is no longer necessary.

Result:

SslHandler's logic is cleaner, with the removal of an unused class and listeners. The performance is potentially improved by optimizing the unwrap loop, and the exception handling is clearer with better logging conditions.","Remove unnecessary code from SslHandler

- Remove CloseNotifyListener which was used only to reduce the noisy logging.

refactor(core): centralize breakpoint management in DBGBaseSession

Refactor DBGBaseSession and PostgreDebugSession to centralize breakpoint management logic. This improves maintainability and consistency across different database session types.
```","Refactor breakpoint management and improve health check streams in debugger and Hystrix

This commit significantly refactors the debug sessions and breakpoint management, extracting common patterns from the `DBGBaseSession` and `PostgreDebugSession` into abstract methods, achieving a much cleaner and DRY-compliant design.

In the Hystrix classes, the health check streams have been updated to reset via `unsubscribe` followed by re-establishment, ensuring health counts are accurately reset. Atomic counter types have been updated, and various commenting and performance-related cleanup has been performed to optimize metric calculations and clarity of the Hystrix circuit breaker and command metrics.

Key changes include:
- Extracting breakpoint manipulation logic into common base class `DBGBaseSession`.
- Replacing explicit breakpoint lists in `PostgreDebugSession` with abstracted methods.
- Unsubscribing and re-establishing health check streams in `HystrixCommandMetrics` to properly reset health counts.
- Updating atomic counter structures for metric counting and removing obsolete extensions.

The commit clear concerns regarding the breakpoint management logic and health check streams, aligns with SOLID principles by enforcing a clear separation of concerns and removes the dependency on any particular breakpoint list implementation in debug sessions.

Additionally, this commit enhances the robustness and maintainability of Hystrix metrics computation, which is crucial for accurate operational monitoring and failure detection.

fix(search): handle search exceptions with conditional throw
```","Enhance AbstractSharedClusterTest utilities to wait for shard relocations and ensure cluster health is green

The code diff provided reflects several changes that were made across different test classes within an Elasticsearch test suite. The changes seem to be geared towards improving test stability and reliability by ensuring that no shards are relocating before performing certain actions like refresh, flush, and optimize. Additionally, the test is updated to strive to ensure the cluster health is green (instead of yellow) which suggests that the cluster health check now requires all primary and replica shards to be active and not initializing nor relocating.

An appropriate commit message summarizing these changes could be:

```
Enhance test utilities to wait for shard relocations before actions

- Update AbstractSharedClusterTest to wait for shard relocations to complete before refresh, flush, and optimize actions.
- Modify ensureGreen method in Cluster health check to wait for zero relocating shards.
- Amend HighlighterSearchTests to require a green cluster health status before executing a search.
- SearchWithRandomExceptionsTests now continues on SearchPhaseException only when all shards failed as expected or if refresh fails with no successful shards.

Refactor DownloadManager to manage waitingForRequirements state

The DownloadManager class has been refactored to handle the state of waiting for requirements more gracefully. This includes:

- The addition of `onDownloadsPausedChanged` and `onWaitingForRequirementsChanged` methods to the `DownloadManager.Listener` interface, signaling changes in the download pause state and waiting for requirements state respectively.
- Internal refactoring to centralize the management of `waitingForRequirements` state.
- A minor fix to ensure that the `isStopped` flag is consistently updated to reflect the actual state of the service.

These changes should improve the clarity of state changes within the `DownloadManager`, making it easier for clients to respond to these events appropriately.

Also, DownloadService has been updated to track the stopped state and include improved logging around service restart attempts. The scheduler logic has been adjusted to act based on the DownloadManager's waiting for requirements state rather than just the requirements state.

Lastly, code comments and method names have been updated for consistency and clarity, including the removal of a superfluous TODO comment.

Related to:
- Issue #1682 where ScheduledAction ignored errors
- Discussing proper trigger conditions for starting the service and the scheduler when requirements state changes.

Note: Remember to update the listeners implementing the DownloadManager.Listener interface to handle new callback methods.
```","Tidy up DownloadService restart. Final change for #6798.

- Add additional Listener methods to DownloadManager, to inform of

- Only schedule the Scheduler if we really are waiting for requirements.

- Only restart the service if we're no longer waiting for requirements,
  and if there are queued downloads that will now be restarted.
  Previously the service would be restarted whenever the requirements
  were met, regardless of whether there was any work to do.

- Restart service if it might be stopping, as well as if it's already
  stopped. Also restart service if there's a download state change to a
  state for which the service should be started, if.

- The original proposal to fix #6798 stored the state change
events in memory until they could be delivered. This approach
is not ideal because the events still end up being delivered

feat(StarlarkRuleContext): evaluate ComputedDefault for attribute default values

This commit updates StarlarkRuleContext to properly handle the evaluation of ComputedDefault instances for attribute default values.

values that are instances of ComputedDefault. Instead of using the direct
return value, we now call `getDefault` on the ComputedDefault instance,

"Enhance support for Reactive types in RequestBodyArgumentResolver and add tests

This commit improves the handling of reactive types in `RequestBodyArgumentResolver`, including direct support for `Mono` and `Flux` without relying on conversion service for these types. Test cases have been extended in `RequestMappingIntegrationTests` to include serialization and handling of `Mono` and `Flux` both in request and response.

Additionally, this commit includes cleanup of imports and minor refactoring in `RequestMappingIntegrationTests`, such as removal of duplicate RestTemplate instantiation.

Ref: #21234","feat: support direct Flux and Mono return types in RequestBodyArgumentResolver

This commit adds enhanced support for `Flux` and `Mono` return types in the `RequestBodyArgumentResolver`, allowing these types to be returned directly without unnecessary conversion. It also includes additional test cases in `RequestMappingIntegrationTests` to ensure that `Flux` and `Mono` are correctly handled in various scenarios such as direct responses and capitalized transformations.

Refs: #42","Ensure proper handling and return types for various reactive types in RequestBodyArgumentResolver

Prior to this commit, the RequestBodyArgumentResolver did not properly handle different reactive types such as Flux or Mono, and it only supported a single element return. This enhancement allows the resolver to correctly handle Mono and Flux types, making it more flexible and adhering to reactive paradigms.

This commit also adds various test cases to the RequestMappingIntegrationTests to validate handling of the newly supported Flux and Mono return types. These tests ensure the correct serialization and processing of reactive types in different endpoint scenarios.

Tests:
- Add tests for handling responses of Flux and Mono types
- Add tests for endpoint creation via `@RequestBody` with Flux and Mono types
- Add tests for capitalization transformations of Flux and Mono elements

Additional code changes include cleaning up imports and adapting to the new reactive types support provided in RequestBodyArgumentResolver.

Fix handling of escape sequences in ArgumentTokenizer

This commit corrects the behavior of the ArgumentTokenizer when it

that regular slashes are properly escaped.

```","Refactor JacocoInstrumentationProcessor for new Java coverage implementation

This commit makes significant changes to the `JacocoInstrumentationProcessor` class. It removes the requirement for a `metadataDir` and instead creates a coverage metadata directory that is unique to each built jar. The `processRequest` method now also directly handles the creation of the coverage metadata directory and its subsequent clean-up.

Additionally, the `SimpleJavaLibraryBuilder` class is refactored to ensure the `JacocoInstrumentationProcessor` instance is cleaned up correctly in a `finally` block after the jar creation and processing steps are complete.

The commit message reflecting the changes:

```
Refactor JacocoInstrumentationProcess and cleanup in SimpleJavaLibraryBuilder

- Modify JacocoInstrumentationProcessor to use a unique coverage metadata directory per jar
- Remove unused metadataDir parameter from JacocoInstrumentationProcessor
- Implement cleanup method in JacocoInstrumentationProcessor to delete temporary coverage metadata directory after processing
- Adjust SimpleJavaLibraryBuilder to properly handle JacocoInstrumentationProcessor's cleanup in a finally block
```","Make JavaBuilder use a unique coverage metadata directory

for each test instead of the same directory for all the tests. The previous implementation was using one directory for instrumenting the classes of a jar. For each each jar the metadata directory was deleted if it already existed. This is problematic for local execution when multiple tests are run in parallel because some threads will try to delete the directory and some will try to perform read/write operations on it.

This is an important fix for Bazel coverage users.

"Add tests to ensure proper LRU cache eviction behavior in LRUMap

This commit extends the test suite for the `LRUMap` implementation with two new test cases. These cases are designed to verify the consistency of the cache eviction process when inserting new entries into a full cache. The tests also check that accessing a key (put operation with an existing key) updates its usage, so it's not considered for eviction during the next insertions.

Specifically, the tests cover scenarios where:

- Inserting a new entry causes the least recently used entry to be evicted.
- Updating an existing entry’s value refreshes its 'recently used' status, thus not being evicted upon subsequent additions.","```

The tests cover scenarios of adding new elements, re-adding existing elements to update their order, and inserting beyond the map's capacity to trigger eviction.

- Test case `put3` confirms LRU ordering and eviction when capacity is reached.
- Test case `put4` verifies LRU logic when re-adding an existing key.

The tests exercise the put operation with different scenarios:

1. Inserting items and updating an existing item's value to confirm that the order is maintained correctly.
2. Inserting items until the cache's capacity is reached and then adding additional items to trigger eviction as per LRU policy.

BREAKING CHANGE: Cluster state access now uses `ClusterServiceState` wrapper, which might affect any code depending on direct `ClusterState` access within `SecurityTribeIT`.","Refactor Elasticsearch suggester components to use QueryShardContext

This commit encompasses a refactoring of several Elasticsearch suggester components to employ QuerySharkContext directly, simplifying the interfaces and enhancing code reusability. Changes include:

1. Addition of QueryShardContext import statements as necessary.
2. Modification of the SuggestionSearchContext to include a member for QueryShardContext, along with getter and setter methods.
3. Update to the SuggestContextParser interface and implementations to receive QueryShardContext instead of multiple services.
4. Adaptation of various suggester classes to leverage the new QueryShardContext member in the SuggestionSearchContext.
5. Streamlining the parseInternal method in the SuggestParseElement to use QueryShardContext directly.
6. Removal of now unnecessary imports such as MapperService and IndexFieldDataService, thanks to the encapsulation provided by QueryShardContext.

Overall, this change leads to a tighter and more coherent suggestion framework, reducing the complexity of method calls and enhancing the overall maintainability of the codebase.

"Refactor StreamElementQueueEntry to handle exceptions with BiFunction in async operation

In this commit, the handling of the future completion in `StreamElementQueueEntry` has been changed from using `thenAcceptAsync` with an `AcceptFunction` to using `handleAsync` with a `BiFunction`. This allows the code to properly deal with exceptions that may occur during the async operation.

Optimize imports and mock environment creation in AsyncWaitOperatorTest

Refine `getLauncher` in Bazel Java rules to return a paired stripped and unstripped launcher. Avoid redundant link actions, which is critical for efficiency in ThinLTO builds. Add hostname parameter to `BazelWorkspaceStatusAction` constructor, and cache hostname to improve build speed.

BREAKING CHANGE: The `getLauncher` method signature is changed to return `Pair<Artifact, Artifact>` instead of a single `Artifact`. Callers will need to adjust to the new API.

This commit streamlines the Java launcher creation process in Bazel's build system, resulting in efficiency improvements when builds are configured with fission.

"Implement rsplit function for string module and refactor partition handling

This commit introduces an `rsplit` function to the string module in the method library, allowing for string splitting from the right with an optional limit on the number of splits. Additionally, it refactors the `partition` function to streamline result conversion and the handling of the current environment. The commit also improves parameter annotations for clarity and fixes the order of parameters in `split` to match the updated behavior.

The `rsplit` implementation addresses the need to handle cases where splitting a string from the right is crucial, such as when processing file paths or URLs. Moreover, the refactor simplifies the usage of the environment object for consistent result conversion across different string manipulation methods.

Overall, the changes enhance the string manipulation capabilities of the method library and make the API usage more intuitive and error-resistant.","feat: Add rsplit method and update split method in MethodLibrary

Added a new 'rsplit' method that splits a string from the right by a given separator and enhanced the 'split' method to accept a new 'sep' parameter directly. This change aligns with standard string manipulation functions and offers more flexibility in handling string operations.

The 'rsplit' method introduction and an update to 'split' provide improved string processing capabilities and fill the gap for right-to-left splitting in our string utilities.

Note: The update to the 'split' method makes the 'sep' parameter mandatory in the function signature, which might impact existing usages expecting a default value.

Add rsplit method and additional parameters to split method in MethodLibrary

This commit introduces a new `rsplit` method in `MethodLibrary` which allows splitting a string into a list from the right side, based on a specified separator and maximum number of splits. Additionally, the existing `split` method has been updated to accept a `sep` parameter and to support environment and location contexts.

The `rsplit` method performs functionality similar to `split`, but starting from the end of the string. The changes also refactor common code paths to ensure consistency and handle the return values properly in the new environment.

- Add rsplit method with full documentation and handling of IllegalArgumentException.
- Update split method signature to explicitly include the `sep` parameter and support the Location and Environment contexts.
- Refactor partitionWrapper to use the new convert utility ensuring proper list creation based on the current environment.

The addition of these string utility methods enhances string manipulation capabilities within the codebase, allowing for increased flexibility and better string processing.

Ensure thread safety in InternalLoggerFactories with AtomicReference

Race condition test cases added for InternalLoggerFactory

Prevent setting a new logger factory if one is already set in InternalLoggerFactory

Enforce singleton property in InternalLoggerFactory using atomic operations","feat(logging): Introduce atomic InternalLoggerFactory in Netty

This commit adds thread-safe initialization of the default log factory by introducing an `AtomicReference` to manage the singleton instance. This ensures that the log factory can be safely set once and that attempts to override it after initialization will result in an `IllegalStateException`.

Resolves #8523","Refactor InternalLoggerFactory to use AtomicReference for thread-safe singleton handling

- Changed InternalLoggerFactory to use a nested InternalLoggerFactoryHolder class with an AtomicReference to ensure thread-safe lazy initialization and single assignment of the default factory.
- Added synchronization logic to prevent multiple initializations and setting of the default factory after it has been used.
- Enhanced testing of thread-safety for getting and setting factory instances in concurrent environments.
- Improved documentation and code readability.

Closes gh-25321","Disallow setting logger factory twice

Motivation:

InternalLoggerFactory either sets a default logger factory
implementation based on the logging implementations on the classpath, or
applications can set a logger factory explicitly. If applications wait
too long to set the logger factory, Netty will have already set a logger
factory leading to some objects using one logging implementation and
other objets using another logging implementation. This can happen too
if the application tries to set the logger factory twice, which is
likely a bug in the application. Yet, the Javadocs for
InternalLoggerFactory warn against this saying that
InternalLoggerFactory#setLoggerFactory ""should be called as early as
possible and shouldn't be called more than once"". Instead, Netty should
guard against this.

Modications:

We replace the logger factory field with an atomic reference on which we
can do CAS operations to safely guard against it being set twice. We
also add an internal holder class that captures the static interface of
InternalLoggerFactory that can aid in testing.

Result:

The logging factory can not be set twice, and applications that want to
set the logging factory must do it before any Netty classes are
initialized (or the default logger factory will be set)."

fix: adjust Ant builder to set correct working directory and pass FilePath object

This commit adjusts the Ant builder implementation to set the working directory to the directory containing the build.xml file.

Now, it explicitly checks for the build file and sets the working directory to its parent directory to mitigate such problems.

Additionally, the stderr copier in the Launcher class has been updated to correctly format the command description with a string representation of the command list, enhancing the clarity of error messages.

"Refactor APIOption to use fixedValue instead of defaultValueFinal

Remove categoryDescriptions parameter from BlazeCommandUtils.expandHelpTopic

Simplify HelpCommand by removing deprecated category handling

Clean up HTML emitting logic in HelpCommand and remove unused code

Remove the deprecated getDeprecatedOptionCategoriesDescriptions method",refactor: remove deprecated option category handling in BlazeCommandUtils,"Refactor `@APIOption` to use `fixedValue` instead of `defaultValueFinal`

Summary:
This commit updates the `@APIOption` annotation to use a `fixedValue` attribute in place of the `defaultValueFinal` boolean. The `fixedValue` attribute ensures that the specified value is always used and custom option values are not accepted.

Key Changes:
- Removed the `defaultValueFinal` attribute from `@APIOption`.
- Added a `fixedValue` array attribute to `@APIOption` to hold the unchangeable option value.
- Updated `APIOptionHandler` to enforce checks against the new `fixedValue` attribute to ensure proper constraints are in place for boolean and non-boolean options.
- Modified `NativeImageOptions` to use the new `fixedValue` array attribute instead of `defaultValue` and `defaultValueFinal`.
- Removed unnecessary parameters and deprecated methods in `BlazeCommandUtils` related to option category descriptions since they are no longer needed with the new `fixedValue` scheme.
- Simplified help command implementation by removing now redundant overloads and parameter `useNewCategoryEnum`.
- Removed outdated category descriptions logic in help command-related classes as part of the cleanup.

The commit simplifies the option declaration and strengthens the module's ability to handle options that should not be overridden by user input.

RELNOTES: Added gRPC keepalive time and timeout configurations for better control over gRPC connections.","Add gRPC keepalive options to AuthAndTLSOptions

This change introduces two new options for AuthAndTLSOptions, enabling the configuration of keep-alive pings for gRPC connections:
- `--grpc_keepalive_time` sets the time after which a keep-alive ping is sent on the transport when there is no read activity.
- `--grpc_keepalive_timeout` defines the amount of time to wait for a keep-alive ping response before closing the connection.

Usage of these options should be coordinated with the service owner to avoid unintended disruptions.

RELNOTES: Added `--grpc_keepalive_time` and `--grpc_keepalive_timeout` options for configuring gRPC keep-alive behavior.","Add --grpc_keepalive_time/grpc_keepalive_timeout

This allows controlling keep-alive pings in the gRPC library. We have
seen cases where GCP's external TCP load balancer silently drops
connections without telling the client. If this happens when the client
is waiting for replies from the server (e.g., when all worker threads
are in blocking 'execute' calls), then the client does not notice the
connection loss and hangs.

In our testing, the client unblocked after ~2 hours without this change,
although we are not sure why (maybe a default Linux Kernel timeout on
TCP connections?). With this flag set to 10 minutes, and running builds
over night, we see repeated 10-minute gaps in remote service utilization,
which seems pretty clear evidence that this is the underlying problem.

The gRPC library has two settings: keep-alive time and keep-alive
timeout. The keep-alive time is the time to wait after the most recent
received packet before sending a keep-alive ping, and the keep-alive
timeout is the time to wait for a reply before concluding that the
connection is dead. The default keep-alive timeout setting is 20s, but
the default keep-alive time setting is infinity (i.e., disable
keep-alive pings).

The gRPC documentation also says to ask the service owner before enabling
keep-alive pings based on the concern that these could generate a lot of
hidden traffic. I don't immediately see how these concerns apply to the
REAPI, and the REAPI also does not have a single service owner. For now,
I'm making this opt-in.

This is difficult to test automatically because there is no easy way to
drop a TCP connection without telling the other end point (for good
reason!).

Subject: Refactor progressive promise API to use explicit progress and total parameters

This series of changes refactors Netty's asynchronous operation tracking by removing the automatic tracking of progress and total from the ProgressivePromise interface and its implementations. Instead, methods that report progress or attempt progress now require explicit 'progress' and 'total' parameters. This change impacts various classes, ensuring consistent progress reporting and providing more flexibility in cases where the 'total' value may only be an estimation or can change dynamically during the operation. Additionally, listeners and promises have been updated to reflect these API adjustments.

Summary of Changes:
- Removed 'progress' and 'total' tracking from ProgressivePromise.
- Updated ProgressivePromise's setProgress and tryProgress methods to require explicit 'progress' and 'total' parameters.
- Modified GenericProgressiveFutureListener and ChannelProgressivePromise interfaces, and their implementations to match the updated API.
- Adjusted FileServer and channel implementations to pass explicit 'progress' and 'total' values.
- Cleaned up documentation and comments to align with the new method contracts.","Allow to construct UnpooledByteBufAllocator that explictly always use sun.misc.Cleaner

"Refactor common service instantiation and DataSource closure logic

The changes in `JavaConfigurationExample` and `YamlConfigurationExample` involve refactoring the methods to initialize and close the `DataSource` in a more structured way.

refactor: optimize resource management by closing DataSource

This change introduces a `closeDataSource` method to ensure that the DataSource resource is properly closed after it has been utilized. Code related to service creation has also been reorganized for better readability. This update contributes to resource management best practices and enhances maintainability.

Resolves some issues where resources could potentially be left open, leading to possible resource leaks in both `JavaConfigurationExample` and `YamlConfigurationExample` classes.

This commit refactors both JavaConfigurationExample and YamlConfigurationExample classes to reorganize the methods `getCommonService` and `closeDataSource`.

Additionally, the private static method `getCommonService` has been reordered for improved readability and maintainability, now appearing closer to the first use within the classes.

The refactoring does not change the application's behavior; it mainly improves the code organization and readability.

Refactor ProtoOutputFormatter to use rule context in attribute inclusion check,"feat: add environment group validation to ensure non-emptiness

BREAKING CHANGE: empty environment groups are no longer allowed, an exception will be thrown if an empty group is defined.

refactor: update ProtoOutputFormatter to include rule context in attribute inclusion logic

This commit introduces a validation check in the `PackageFactory` to enforce that environment groups contain at least one environment, preventing the creation of empty environment groups which now throws an `EvalException`. It also refactors the `ProtoOutputFormatter` class by changing the signature of the `includeAttribute` method to accept the `Rule` object as an additional parameter, allowing attribute inclusion logic to take the rule context into account.","Fix environment group validation and update test suite; adjust attribute filtering logic in ProtoOutputFormatter

- Ensure that an `EvalException` is thrown if an environment group is created with an empty list of environments, enforcing that each environment group must contain at least one environment.
- Update and refine test cases in `EnvironmentGroupTest` to reflect the enhancement in environment group validation and adhere to naming conventions by removing the 'test' prefix from test method names.
- Modify the `includeAttribute` method signature in `ProtoOutputFormatter` to accept `Rule` as a parameter, enhancing attribute filtering based on the rule as well as the attribute.","Allow to filter attributes based on the rule of the attribute.

- Added a field to store an instance of the AuthenticationManager and the AuthenticationEventPublisher within the LazyAuthenticationManager class.
- Modified the `authenticate` method of LazyAuthenticationManager to initialize the authenticationManager with the builder only when it is first needed, and to apply the AuthenticationEventPublisher if it is an instance of ProviderManager.
- Adjusted the tests within SecurityAutoConfigurationTests to remove the AtomicReference wrapper in favor of a dedicated AuthenticationListener class, simplifying the event listening logic for testing purposes.

"Extend TransformerUtils with StAX Source/Result detection and accessors

This commit adds the capability to detect and work with StAX `Source` and `Result` in the `TransformerUtils` class. It introduces utility methods for determining if an instance is a StAX `Source` or `Result`, and for retrieving `XMLStreamReader`, `XMLStreamWriter`, `XMLEventReader`, and `XMLEventWriter` from them.

With these additions, it becomes easier to integrate StAX sources or results when working with transformations, alleviating the need for clients to manually check and cast to the appropriate StAX interfaces.

In addition to the functionality, relevant tests were also added to ensure the correctness of these utilities.

Issue: SPR-14240","feat: Enhance TransformerUtils with StAX Source/Result support

The `TransformerUtils` class in Spring Framework has been updated to include methods that can detect, handle, and retrieve `XMLStreamReader`, `XMLEventReader`, `XMLStreamWriter`, and `XMLEventWriter` instances from StAX `Source` and `Result` objects.

Additionally, the class now includes compatibility with JAXP 1.4 StAX Source (`StAXSource`) and Result (`StAXResult`).

Tests have been expanded to verify the new features.

See also:
- `isStaxSource(Source source)`
- `isStaxResult(Result result)`
- `getXMLStreamReader(Source source)`
- `getXMLEventReader(Source source)`
- `getXMLStreamWriter(Result result)`
- `getXMLEventWriter(Result result)`","Extend TransformerUtils to support StAX Source and Result checks

Added StAX Source and Result type checking, reader retrieval, and writer retrieval to TransformerUtils. The changes expand upon the previous utilities to accommodate transformations involving the StAX API, which can be instrumental when dealing with XML streaming.

New utility methods check if the provided Source or Result instances are based on StAX. They also enable extraction of XMLStreamReader, XMLEventReader, XMLStreamWriter, and XMLEventWriter from StAX Source and Result objects. These changes facilitate StAX-based XML processing, providing Spring users with a more versatile toolset for XML transformations.

Tests were updated to verify the StAX utility methods' correctness, ensuring they recognize valid StAX Source and Result instances and reject non-StAX ones.

- Significantly refactor `finishAllocatedObjects` to allow an insertion point parameter and update relevant call sites
- Update barrier insertion method to use new insertion point parameter
- Make `fieldStoreBarrierType` and `arrayStoreBarrierType` public in `DefaultJavaLoweringProvider`

Add test case for canonicalization in PartialEscapeAnalysisTest

- Implement `testCanonicalize` test method with asserts for return node count and result verification

refactor: change access modifiers and method parameters for LoweringProviders

This commit includes several changes to the access modifiers of methods
within the DefaultHotSpotLoweringProvider and DefaultJavaLoweringProvider
classes, shifting from protected to public visibility. Additionally,
the signature for the finishAllocatedObjects method has been updated to
include an additional parameter which changes the insertion point for
allocations. Bug fixes have been applied to ensure correct allocation
barriers.

Additionally, refactor PartialEscapeAnalysisTest and EATestBase for
simplified method signatures by removing the `final` keyword from the
parameters of test methods and removing unnecessary final parameter
annotations.
```","Refactor visibility of methods and improve commit allocation handling

This commit makes several changes to the method visibility and the handling of commit allocations:
- Change the visibility of `fieldLoadBarrierType`, `createOffsetAddress`, and `createFieldAddress` from `protected` to `public` to allow access from other classes.
- Modify `finishAllocatedObjects` to accept `insertAfter` as an additional parameter and update all usages accordingly, improving the flexibility of the allocation insertion process.
- Refactor the `insertAllocationBarrier` method to take `insertAfter` as a parameter, providing better control over barrier node insertion.

Additionally, in the EATestBase and PartialEscapeAnalysisTest test files, this commit standardizes parameter passing and adds a new test case `testCanonicalize` to validate the canonicalization process.

refactor: update MetaAnnotationUtilsTests assertion method names

This commit refactors several assertion method names in MetaAnnotationUtilsTests to better reflect their purpose. Specifically, methods that assert on a composed annotation with the `@Component` meta-annotation now use a consistent naming convention, starting with `assertAtComponentOnComposedAnnotation`. Moreover, adjustment has been done in the method parameters to accommodate the root declaring class in the assertions.

No new functionality is introduced and the test logic remains unchanged.

Issue: SPR-10389
```","Refactor MetaAnnotationUtilsTests to improve test method naming and assertions

In this update, the `MetaAnnotationUtilsTests` class undergoes a few key changes:

1. The method naming has been made more consistent and self-explanatory, which improves readability. The `assertComponentOnStereotype` method was renamed to `assertAtComponentOnComposedAnnotation` to better indicate that the assertion is about `@Component` on a composed annotation.

2. The `assertAtComponentOnComposedAnnotation` method was overloaded to handle cases with and without a `rootDeclaringClass`, enhancing the flexibility of the testing suite.

3. The `assertAtComponentOnComposedAnnotation` methods have been refactored to capture both the `rootDeclaringClass` and the `declaringClass` of the composed annotation for more precise testing.

4. The test cases now use the improved method signatures that reflect the more descriptive method names and parameters, ensuring that the intent of the tests is clearer and that the assertions are accurate.

5. Copyright notice years were updated in the class file to reflect the latest year of modification.

These changes ensure that the test methods now perform more comprehensive and intention-revealing assertions regarding meta-annotations and composed annotations within the test class. Overall, this enhances the clarity and maintainability of the test suite.",Simplify MetaAnnotationUtilsTests

The provided code diff shows that the `ManifestDecoder` class has been refactored to use a new `nullSafeEqualsIgnoreOrder` method instead of the deprecated `nullSafeEquals` method for comparing the lists with elements that might have been reordered. Additionally, several `EqualsChecker` implementations (for permissions, uses-features, and uses-permissions) have been removed, which suggests that these checks have either been inlined or are no longer needed due to the adoption of the new comparison approach.

"Add packet continuity checks in TsExtractor

This commit introduces packet continuity verification in the TsExtractor class. If a TS packet discontinuity is detected (e.g., a duplicate packet or a gap in the continuity counter), the new logic skips processing of the problematic packet, thereby safeguarding the extractor against potential synchronization issues. A `SparseIntArray` is used to keep track of the last known continuity counter per PID.

Key changes:
- Added `SparseIntArray continuityCounters` to maintain continuity counter state.
- Implemented logic to detect and handle discontinuity within the `read` method.
- Packets found to be duplicates or exhibiting discontinuity are now skipped.","feat: Add discontinuity handling to TsExtractor

Add handling for discontinuity flags and duplicate packet detection in TS streams. This improves the robustness of the extractor against stream errors and inconsistencies. The extractor now tracks continuity counters per PID and uses them to detect discontinuities and duplicate packets, ensuring that the payloads are passed to the payload readers only if they represent valid, sequential TS packets.

The change includes:
- A new `SparseIntArray` to track continuity counters.
- Logic to detect and skip duplicate packets.
- Logic to invoke `seek()` on payload readers when discontinuities are found, before consuming the payload.

This update should lead to more reliable playback in the presence of problematic TS segments, handling cases where TS packets may have been repeated or missed due to errors in the stream.

Issue: [#6798 related]
PiperOrigin-RevId: 289678123","Add continuity counter check to TsExtractor

This change adds a continuity counter check to the TS extractor logic, which helps to identify and handle packet discontinuities and duplicate packets in the transport stream. The implementation involves maintaining a `SparseIntArray` of continuity counters, indexed by packet ID, to track the expected continuity value for each incoming packet. When a discontinuity or duplicate is detected, the packet is ignored, and the appropriate handling (skipping the packet or resetting the reader state) is performed.

Key points:
- Continuity count logic aids in ensuring the integrity of the transport stream by detecting out-of-order packets.
- Duplicate packets are detected and discarded to prevent processing of redundant data.
- On detection of a packet discontinuity, payload readers are instructed to seek, resetting their state to handle the discontinuity appropriately.

"Remove custom LangtoolsClassLoader; Use BazelJavaCompiler's classloader directly

refactor(timer): simplify timing mechanism and remove TimerTask dependency

Removed TimerTask and related code to simplify timing logic within the Timer class. Timer stop method now sets a 'stopped' flag instead of calling timer.cancel(), ensuring thread safety and a clear exception is thrown if the timer has been stopped. Deprecated the use of interrupting threads for timeout handling, reducing potential issues with multithreading in WebDriver instances.

BREAKING CHANGE: Timer now throws an IllegalStateException if attempted to run after being stopped, instead of a NullPointerException with the previous stack trace. Timeout is now checked directly post-command execution, throwing SeleniumException on timeout.

refactor(compiler): remove LangtoolsClassLoader custom classloader from BazelJavaCompiler

Deleted the custom LangtoolsClassLoader and its usage, simplifying the process to acquire the JavaCompiler class. The custom classloader logic is now omitted, using BazelJavaCompiler's own classLoader instead—enhancing maintainability and reducing classpath complexity. Also replaced a RuntimeException with a more precise LinkageError when a compiler is unobtainable.

BREAKING CHANGE: The custom classloader for loading the Java compiler has been removed. This may affect cases where the classpath was relying on the LangtoolsClassLoader's behavior. Users should verify and adjust their classpath if necessary.
```","Here are appropriate commit messages for the given code diffs:

For the Timer class changes:

```
Refactor Timer class for consistency in single-threaded WebDriver 

Remove usage of TimerTask and java.util.Timer in Timer. Instead of creating a new thread and scheduling a task, the new implementation checks the execution time immediately after running the command. If execution exceeds the defined timeout, a SeleniumException is thrown. Add a flag to track stopped state and throw IllegalStateException if the timer is stopped and a run is attempted.

This change aims to ensure more consistent behavior of the emulated driver when commands time out, at the cost of potentially slower test execution.
```

For the BazelJavaCompiler class changes:

```
Remove custom LangtoolsClassLoader from BazelJavaCompiler

Simplify BazelJavaCompiler by using the current class loader for obtaining the JavaCompiler class instead of creating a custom URLClassLoader subclass with the Langtools Jar. Eliminate unnecessary URLClassLoader complexity and reduce the risk of classpath pollution by multiple instances of langtools.

This cleanup will help avoid class path issues and aid in automated Java dependency analysis.

"Refactor error attribute handling to consolidate ResponseStatus retrieval

This commit optimizes error attribute generation by retrieving the ResponseStatus annotation only once per error. Additionally, it refines the message handling to ensure an empty string is assigned if the error message is null, preventing any null message leaks in the error attributes.

Update deserialization logic to save all deserialized children in an `ArrayList` to keep references and avoid premature garbage collection until the top-level `NestedSet` has been fully constructed.","Optimize NestedSet deserialization to prevent GC of child references

The `NestedSetCodec` class has been updated to optimize the deserialization process. During deserialization, an `ArrayList` is now used to maintain references to all child `NestedSet` objects. Previously, only the last deserialized `NestedSet` was assigned, resulting in the loss of reference for the eventual garbage collection of earlier child `NestedSet` objects. The updated implementation ensures that references to all child `NestedSet` objects are retained by adding them to the `ArrayList`, `childrenForThisNestedSet`, preventing their premature garbage collection. The top-level `NestedSet` is then created using the last element from this list, which represents the root of the nested structure.

The commit includes several enhancements and fixes to the StringObservable class:

1. Added Javadoc comments to some methods for better understanding and clarity.
2. Fixed an issue where the from(Reader i) method did not properly handle the end of the buffer when converting characters to a String, leading to incorrect String output.
3. Improved the decode method to unsubscribe correctly, avoiding unnecessary processing when unsubscribed.
4. Made some clarifications in the existing documentation for consistency and readability.
5. Introduced a new `Line` static inner class to represent a numbered line of text and implemented the `byLine` method that emits `Line` objects representing each line of text along with their line numbers.

The StringObservableTest class was also updated:
1. Added testFromInputStream to validate proper conversion from an InputStream to an Observable of bytes.
2. Added testFromReader to validate proper conversion from a Reader to an Observable string output.
3. Added testByLine to validate the newly introduced `byLine` method that splits a concatenated string into observable lines.

Commit Message:
```
Add Javadocs, bug fixes, and byLine method for numbered line splitting to StringObservable

- Add Java documentation for methods responsible for creating Observables from InputStream and Reader.
- Fix the off-by-one error in from(Reader i, int size) where complete strings were emitted without respecting buffer utilization.
- Include unsubscribe check in the decode method to halt processing if the observer is unsubscribed.
- Clarify the comment on the decode method's handling of multibyte character splitting across chunks.
- Update documentation formatting in the split method for better readability.
- Introduce the Line inner class to represent lines with their respective numbers.
- Implement the byLine method that emits Lines, effectively splitting text based on the system's line separator.

Tests:
- Add tests for string conversion from InputStream and Reader validating the return of correct data.
- Add byLine method test to ensure it correctly splits and numbers lines in a stream.

Explanation: The change includes two parts. First, a semicolon is added to the end of the `addAll` method call to correct the syntax, which is a minor fix. Second, the method signature of `getMasterDataSourceNames` is corrected to make the return type explicit (`Collection<String>`) instead of `void`.

Fix wrapper node replacement check in Truffle InstrumentationHandler

This commit resolves an issue related to the replacement of nodes in the Truffle Instrumentation API. It ensures a valid WrapperNode is returned and safely replaces nodes by adding a check before the replacement process. If the current parent is a wrapper, we replace the wrapper node instead of the direct instrumentable node, to maintain instrumentation integrity.

Changes include:
- Adding a null check for the wrapper object returned by the instrumentable node.
- Introducing getWrapperNodeChecked method to ensure a non-null wrapper node is used.
- Performing a node replacement check based on the parent's wrapper status to address possible unsafe replacement conditions.

4. Simplify `LLVMDispatchNode` by removing boundary annotations and optimizing foreign function invocation handling.
5. Clean up unused imports and methods in `LLVMInvokeNode`.","fix: adjust visibility and invocation mechanics for various methods

In this commit, method visibility has been modified across several classes to facilitate better access patterns. Notably, `fieldLoadBarrierType` and address creation methods in `DefaultHotSpotLoweringProvider` and `DefaultJavaLoweringProvider` have been promoted to `public` to allow more flexible usage.

Additionally, key changes include a refactor within the `finishAllocatedObjects` method in `DefaultJavaLoweringProvider` to include an extra `insertAfter` parameter, which addresses previous concerns regarding insertion points of allocation barriers and anchor nodes in the provided Graph structure.

Furthermore, the invocation mechanism in LLVM has been updated. Refactoring in the `LLVMBitcodeInstructionVisitor` and related classes like `BasicNodeFactory` and `LLVMInvokeNode` involve a shift from using `FrameSlot` for result locations to the more flexible `LLVMWriteNode` for writing function results. This change advances the codebase towards a more coherent and maintainable architecture, particularly in the way function results are handled across LLVM function invoke operations.

The `LLVMDispatchNode` also sees minor updates, primarily removing redundant checks and optimizations for method invocation paths, aligning the codebase with the latest performance best practices.

Finally, the `LLVMStart` class received a tweak to utilize `LLVMGlobal` directly, thereby streamlining the approach for accessing vtable types in the context of language start internals, fostering more straightforward language interoperability.

These changes collectively strive to enhance code clarity, maintainability, and performance across the modified subsystems.","Refactor visibility and method parameters to improve reusability and extendibility

- Change method visibility from `protected` to `public` for `fieldLoadBarrierType`, `createOffsetAddress`, and `createFieldAddress` in `DefaultHotSpotLoweringProvider` and `DefaultJavaLoweringProvider` to allow usage in extending classes.
- Update `finishAllocatedObjects` to take an additional parameter `insertAfter` to specify the node after which new nodes should be inserted, improving control over node insertion order.
- Modify `createFunctionInvoke` in `NodeFactory` and its implementations to use a `writeResult` parameter instead of `resultLocation` frame slot for better encapsulation of write logic.
- Refactor `LLVMLookupDispatchForeignNode` in `LLVMDispatchNode` for clearer logic and improved comprehensibility by removing unnecessary asserts and using named members for function type attributes.
- Remove redundant checks and replace `TruffleBoundary` annotation with `CompilerAsserts.neverPartOfCompilation` to adhere to Truffle API usage in `LLVMDispatchNode`.
- Streamline result writing logic in `LLVMInvokeNode` by incorporating the `LLVMWriteNode` into the node hierarchy, eliminating the need for manual type checks and frame slot writes.
- Correct `createLangStartVtable` signature in `LLVMStart` to take an `LLVMGlobal` parameter, ensuring type safety and context awareness for vtable creation.

This commit changes the method used to parse boolean system properties from `Boolean.valueOf(String)` to `Boolean.parseBoolean(String)`. The change is applied in both `DefaultHomeFinder` and `GraalVMLocator` classes. This avoids unnecessary boxing and aligns the code with standard practices for parsing boolean values from system properties or environment variables.

"Update ClasspathLoggingApplicationListener to react to environment events

Change the event type triggering the classpath logging from ApplicationStartedEvent to ApplicationEnvironmentPreparedEvent to better align with the initialization phase of the application.

Change ClasspathLoggingApplicationListener to log the classpath during the ApplicationEnvironmentPreparedEvent rather than the deprecated ApplicationStartedEvent. This ensures classpath information is logged at the correct initialization time.

Ref #1729 Update listener for Spring Boot 2.x compatibility","Log classpath once environment has been prepared

Previously, the classpath would be logged in response to the
ApplicationStartedEvent. At this point, logging could be disabled
while the logging system is being initialized, or because the
log levels configured in the environment have not yet been applied.

This commit moves the logging to happen in response to an
ApplicationEnvironmentPreparedEvent by which point the logging
system has been initialized and its levels have been configured.

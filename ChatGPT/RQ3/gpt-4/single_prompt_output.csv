fix: prevent simultaneous zookeeper and etcd configuration in YamlOrchestration

This commit introduces a validation check in the getOrchestrationConfiguration method to ensure that either zookeeper or etcd is used as a registry center, but not both concurrently, thus preventing misconfiguration that could lead to runtime exceptions or unexpected behavior. A RuntimeException is thrown if both are configured simultaneously.

"Commit messages generally encapsulate the main changes that were implemented in the codebase. Here are the commit messages that reflect the changes made in the `JDBCTable.java` and `GenericFilterValueEdit.java` files:

### `JDBCTable.java` changes:

1. **Refactor `getDictionaryValues` function for improved readability:**
```
Refactor getDictionaryValues signature and body for cleaner formatting and readability
```

2. **Remove pre-processing of numeric key patterns:**
```
Remove modification of numeric key patterns in getDictionaryValues method
```

3. **Adjust `searchInKeys` logic and simplify string key pattern handling:**
```
Refine key pattern handling logic for numeric and string data kinds in getDictionaryValues
```

4. **Restore wildcard key pattern handling for non-numeric data:**
```

```

5. **Streamline `bindValueObject` calls:**
```
Streamline bindValueObject calls with appropriate data kind checks and handling
```

It seems as though the handling of `keyPattern` has been reworked. This possibly addresses bugs or changes behavior, so it's important to ensure that a proper description of the change is included in the commit message.

### `GenericFilterValueEdit.java` changes:

1. **Add mergeResultsWithData parameter to `loadMultiValueList`:**
```
Extend loadMultiValueList to support merging results with data conditionally
```

2. **Implement conditional merging of results in multivaluelist loading:**
```
Implement conditional logic for merging fetched rows with values in multivalue list loading
```

3. **Refactor enumeration loading with merge control:**
```
Refactor enumeration value loading to delegate merge control to the caller
```

For the second file, the changes seem to focus on decoupling the loading of multiple values from a fixed behavior, making it conditional based on the state or inputs of the program. This could be an enhancement aimed at providing more flexible functionality to the filter value editing process.

Please note that commit messages should be as descriptive as necessary to convey the context and intent of the changes. The above examples are relatively brief; depending on the project's requirements, it might be appropriate to include more details or reasoning behind the changes made.","```

feat(UndertowServerHttpRequest): implement reference counting for pooled buffer management

Refactor UndertowServerHttpRequest to use reference counting for managing the lifecycle of the pooled data buffer. This change includes the implementation of retain/release logic, atomic reference count handling, and modifying buffer manipulation methods to return 'this' for method chaining. Additionally, the `slice` method now returns a new `UndertowDataBuffer` that shares the same reference count, ensuring proper memory management when slicing the buffer.

refactor: optimize resource duplication removal and handle exceptions

Code has been refactored to generalize the deletion of duplicated resources in both RunApp and RunMojo classes. Exception handling has been improved by catching IOException in RunMojo's `addResources` method. Old special case handling of `logback.xml` file removal has been removed and replaced with a broader approach for any duplicated resource.
```",Refactor resource cleanup and resolve duplicate entries in target directories,"Remove duplicate resources from classpath

We had been making a special case for logback.xml anyway, so
extending that to simply deleting recursively all of
src/main/resources (or equivalent) from target/classes (or
equivalent) seems like it's perfectly justifiable.

- Adjust the random number of requests in async tests to be between 5 and 20 for broader coverage.
- Store responses and exceptions in a thread-safe `CopyOnWriteArrayList` to safely aggregate results from concurrent execution.
- Remove the assertion that exceptions must be instances of `ResponseException` within the `onFailure` method.
- Refactor response assertion logic into the `TestResponse` class for improved clarity and encapsulation.
- Ensure that the number of received responses matches the number of requests sent.
- Implement a new private nested `TestResponse` class to manage both successful and error responses uniformly.

Refactor integer multiplication to use constant resolution in AMD64Arithmetic

Change the immediate operand handling in multiplication instructions to use the CompileResultBuilder's resolution method for integer constants. This update involves modifying the 'imull' and 'imulq' method calls for both register and memory operands to ensure consistent handling of immediate values.

- Update `imul` instruction handling to utilize `crb.asIntConst` for immediate values.
- Adjust `imulq` instruction to a consistent approach for constants via `crb` methods.
```

Breakdown of changes:

1. `masm.imull(asIntReg(result), asIntReg(x), y.asInt());` is now `masm.imull(asIntReg(result), asIntReg(x), crb.asIntConst(y));`
2. `masm.imulq(asLongReg(result), asLongReg(x), y.asInt());` is now `masm.imulq(asLongReg(result), asLongReg(x), crb.asIntConst(y));`
3. `masm.imull(asIntReg(result), (AMD64Address) crb.asIntAddr(x), y.asInt());` is now `masm.imull(asIntReg(result), (AMD64Address) crb.asIntAddr(x), crb.asIntConst(y));`
4. `masm.imulq(asLongReg(result), (AMD64Address) crb.asLongAddr(x), y.asInt());` is now `masm.imulq(asLongReg(result), (AMD64Address) crb.asLongAddr(x), crb.asIntConst(y));`

Currently, pending stream offset changes are kept until an output buffer

problematic if the next stream offset overlaps with the current output
buffer sample times (e.g. because the next stream starts at a non-zero start
time).

To correctly time the switch to the next stream offset, this change keeps
the timestamp of the last queued input sample as switch point. And we only
switch to the new offset after an output sample timestamp reached this switch
point.

```
Add case-insensitive pattern matching for connection reset and closed errors in SslHandler
```

Commit message 2:
```
Implement message-based check for ignorable exceptions in SslHandler's ignoreException method
```

Explanation of changes:
- A new regex pattern `IGNORABLE_ERROR_MESSAGE` has been added to match ignorable errors based on the exception message including cases such as ""connection reset"", ""connection closed"", and ""broken pipe"", with a case-insensitive flag to ensure matching is not affected by the casing of the error message.
- An additional conditional block that utilizes the newly added pattern has been inserted within the `ignoreException` method. This check uses the new regex pattern to quickly determine if the exception message corresponds to a known ignorable type before resorting to stack trace analysis.
- The stack trace analysis section in the `ignoreException` method has been updated, removing checks for `Socket` and `DatagramSocket` classes, presumably because the newly added message-based check can now uniformly handle exceptions from these classes.","```

"Based on the provided code diffs, here are the commit messages reflecting the changes made to each part of the `DownloadManager.java` file:

1. **Removed call to maybeStartDownloads() after clearing stop flags:**
   ```
   Remove redundant maybeStartDownloads() call in clearStopFlags method
   
   This commit removes an unnecessary call to `maybeStartDownloads()` in the `clearStopFlags` method, streamlining the download starting logic and potentially fixing a bug where downloads could be started prematurely.
   ```

2. **Changed isStarted() check to isIdle() in the conditional:**
   ```
   Replace isStarted() check with isIdle() to improve download check logic
   
   Previously, the download manager was checking if each download is started before proceeding. This commit changes that check to `isIdle()`, providing a more accurate indication of whether a download is ready to proceed.
   ```

3. **Refactored addDownloadForAction method logic:**
   ```
   Refactor addDownloadForAction to use addAction and simplify the logic
   
   This commit refactors the `addDownloadForAction` method to call `addAction` on the `Download` class directly. The logic has been simplified, and index checking has been internalized in the `addAction` method.
   ```

4. **Removed `maybeStartDownloads()` method comments and updated the method:**
   ```
   Clean unused maybeStartDownloads method and streamline its implementation
   
   The outdated comments have been removed, and the method now only starts downloads if DownloadManager is correctly initialized and not released. It skips the previously included checks which were moved elsewhere.
   ```

5. **Updated `maybeStartDownload` and added `maybeRestartDownload` methods:**
   ```
   Update maybeStartDownload logic and add new maybeRestartDownload method
   
   The `maybeStartDownload` method logic is updated to include necessary checks for initialization and release status before starting a download. Additionally, a new `maybeRestartDownload` method has been added to handle specific restart logic.
   ```

6. **Changed logic in `onDownloadThreadStopped`:**
   ```
   Modify download thread stopped logic in onDownloadThreadStopped method
   
   This commit changes how the `Download` inner class handles a stopped download thread. The logic now checks for errors and adjusts the download state accordingly, with a new check for the `STATE_REMOVING` and `STATE_RESTARTING` states.
   ```

7. **Refactored addAction method in the Download class:**
   ```
   Refactor addAction to return a boolean and check action type before adding
   
   The `addAction` method within the `Download` inner class has been refactored to return a boolean indicating success, and now performs a check on the type of action before adding it. It also introduces new state checks and potential thread stopping if a different action is underway.
   ```

8. **Removed `DownloadAction action` attribute from Download class:**
   ```
   Remove unused DownloadAction field from Download inner class
   
   The private field `DownloadAction action` was not being used after previous refactors, and therefore has been removed to clean up the inner class and avoid holding unnecessary references.
   ```

9. **Reordered invocation of `maybeStartDownloads` in the init:**
   ```
   Reorder initialization logic to call maybeStartDownloads at the correct time
   
   This commit modifies the order in which methods are called during initialization to ensure `maybeStartDownloads` is invoked after DownloadManager is fully initialized but before notifying listeners.

The message captures the key changes in the `getFile` method within the `ServletContextResource` class. The original `getURL()` call has been replaced with a direct call to `this.servletContext.getResource(this.path)`, likely for more direct or efficient resource retrieval.

Ensure cancellation of background renewal of retention leases after recovery

In this update, the test case for retention lease behavior during recovery has been enhanced. We added additional logic to confirm that the background renewal of retention leases is effectively cancelled upon completion of recovery. This verification is accomplished by introducing a wait step that utilizes a sleep interval derived from the lease renew interval setting. This approach ensures that if any renewals were to occur, they would be detected by comparing the lease timestamps before and after the sleep. The changes ensure that the test accurately measures whether retention leases are not being erroneously renewed after recovery, ensuring more robust lease management.

1. Optimize array allocation in ResultSetModel
```
Refactor array allocation in nested attribute binding

This change optimizes the way arrays are allocated when copying nested
attribute bindings. Instead of using the size of the list, it now uses
a size of 0 which allows the toArray method to create an array of the
right size.
```

2. Add support for metadata changes in data filter update
```
Extend updateDataFilter to handle metadata changes

The `updateDataFilter` method in ResultSetModel has been modified to
accept a new boolean parameter `metaChanged`. This indicates whether
metadata has changed, leading to different handling of the data filter
update, particularly in attribute visibility and positions.
```

3. Ensure visual position consistency in ResultSetModel
```
Adjust attribute visibility logic based on visual position

ResultSetModel now checks the visual position when updating data
filters to ensure consistency with constraint attributes. This can
avoid potential issues with attributes having the same name but different
positions in result sets in certain databases.
```

4. Propagate metadata change flag in ResultSetViewer
```
Update ResultSetViewer to pass metadata change flag

The call to `model.updateDataFilter` within ResultSetViewer now passes
a flag to indicate that metadata changes have occurred. This ensures
that the viewer and model remain in sync after such changes, particularly
after applying a new data filter.

Remove assertion for loop header without a loop condition in BottomUpAllocator

This update removes an assertion check from the BottomUpAllocator class that ensures a loop header block either has a successor block or a self-referencing successor if there's only one.

The removal simplifies the handling of PHIs in the given context without impacting the allocator's functionality.

"Based on the code diff provided, it looks like the update to the `FlinkMetricContainer` class modifies the behavior of how events are marked in a meter. Originally, the code marked the event with the raw `update` value from `metricResult.getAttempted()`. The updated code appears to subtract the current count from the update value before marking the event, likely to account only for the new events since the last count.

Here are a few suggested commit messages capturing this change:

1. ""Adjust meter event marking to incremental updates""

2. ""Fix meter event count to reflect new events only""

3. ""Update FlinkMetricContainer to correct event marking logic""

Refactor FadeOut to start from current alpha value

This update changes the `FadeOut` class to begin the fade-out
effect from the target actor's current alpha value instead of
setting it to full opacity by default. This allows for natural
continuation if the actor is already partially transparent.
```

Explanation:
The changes in the code indicate that previously, the `FadeOut` animation would always start with the target actor's alpha value set to a fully opaque value (1.0). The change to `startAlpha` and `deltaAlpha` calculations means that the animation now initiates from the actor's current alpha value, decrementing by that amount to potentially reach full transparency. The commit message reflects this change in behavior, highlighting why it is meaningful.","```
fix(FadeOut): retain original alpha in setTarget method

Correct the logic in the setTarget method of the FadeOut class to initialize startAlpha and deltaAlpha based on the target actor's current alpha value, instead of hardcoding them to 1 and -1 respectively. This ensures the fade-out animation starts from the actor's existing transparency.
```",Optimize setTarget in FadeOut to use current alpha value,[fixed] The start and delta of the alpha value have been initialized with 1 (and -1) and not the actual alpha of the target.

""Refactor ToolsMenuHandler to utilize instance-level MenuManager""

The commit message above summarizes the modifications done to the `ToolsMenuHandler` class:

1. A new instance variable for `MenuManager` has been introduced.
2. The local declaration of `MenuManager` within the `execute` method has been replaced with an instance-level object, including proper disposal before re-instantiation.

The message encapsulates the intent behind the code changes, indicating the move towards using a class member for menu management rather than a method-local variable. This change likely reflects an architectural decision aimed at improving the class design, manageability, and potentially the performance of the menu handling logic.","```

"Improved WebSocket08FrameDecoder performance by removing debug logging of bytes

This commit opts to remove the detailed debug logging of the byte array in the WebSocket08FrameDecoder class. Previously, each byte of the UTF-8-encoded payload was being converted into a hexadecimal string and appended to a StringBuilder, which was then logged. This could potentially lead to performance issues, especially for large byte arrays. The removal of this logging should increase the performance during the UTF-8 validation checks, primarily by reducing memory allocations and CPU cycles spent on string manipulation and logging operations that are not essential for production environments. This change is particularly useful for high-throughput WebSocket services where minimal latency and overhead are crucial. Debug logging can still be reintroduced if necessary for troubleshooting specific issues.","```

Add conditional index refresh after every 10th document index in SearchStatsTests

This commit introduces a change in the SearchStatsTests class where after every 10th document is indexed, a refresh action is executed on the ""test1"" index. This change ensures that the indexed documents are immediately searchable for tests that require it. Note: The refresh is only applied to the ""test1"" index and should be reviewed if the ""test2"" index requires the same behavior.
```

Details to note:

- The commit message clearly states the purpose of the change.
- The message points out that the refresh is conditional, happening after the 10th document.
- By saying ""Note:"", it highlights that the refresh is only applied to ""test1"", which should be intentional, but it's made clear in case this was an oversight.
- The commit message implies that a similar change is not made to ""test2"", and this might need addressing depending on the intent of the test.","```

The change indicates an update to the way drivers are matched in the Project Import Wizard.

refactor(chip): simplify padding calculation and remove onDraw override

This commit streamlines the padding calculation logic within the updatePaddingInternal method, removing the overly complex conditional padding additions and structure.

Additionally, the calculateCloseIconWidth method in ChipDrawable has been made package-private to align with the new padding calculation requirements.
```",Refactor Chip padding and remove onDraw canvas translation,"Fixes Chip text padding & drawing.

The previous code was setting total padding (both start & end) as just end padding of the parent TextView and relying on the invalidation phase drawing the text in the correct place by shifting canvas with computed offset of start padding. This is risky as Chip may be just re-laid without actually invalidating it and render wrong paddings. Also RTL layout direction is incorrectly identified as LTR during layout sometimes, which makes the text being rendered with incorrect offset.

This change sets the paddings correctly removing the need of manual offsetting during onDraw() and relies purely on TextView for its text rendering.

Add tests for edge cases in decoding query strings

This commit introduces a series of unit tests to the RestUtilsTests class for handling edge cases in the decodeQueryString method. New test scenarios include handling empty parameters, consecutive ampersands, lone key/value indicators, and erroneous keys without values. The added tests ensure robust handling of unusual query string structures and enforce the expected behavior of the RestUtils.decodeQueryString method.

it arises the question of what behavior is desirable

feat: add lazy loading to HttpMessageConverters

```",Added @Lazy annotation to HttpMessageConverters parameter and test for custom HttpMessageConverter to prevent bean cycle,"Allow HttpMsgConverter to depend on ConvService without creating a cycle

In an MVC web application, DelegatingWebMvcConfiguration provides the
ConversionService while also consuming WebMvcConfigurerAdapters that,
among other things, can configure HTTP message converters. Boot's
WebMvcConfigurerAdapter, WebMvcAutoConfigurationAdapter, consumes
the HttpMessageConverters bean and uses it to configure Spring MVC's
HTTP message converters. This can create a bean dependency cycle if
an HTTP message converter bean depends, directly or indirectly on
the ConversionService. An example of the cycle is:

┌─────┐
|  jsonComponentConversionServiceCycle.ThingDeserializer defined in …
↑     ↓
|  org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.web.WebMvcAutoConfiguration$EnableWebMvcConfiguration
↑     ↓

↑     ↓
|  jacksonObjectMapper defined in class path resource [org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/jackson/JacksonAutoConfiguration$JacksonObjectMapperConfiguration.class]
└─────┘

This commit breaks the cycle by making WebMvcAutoConfigurationAdapter
consume HttpMessageConverters lazily. This allows the adapter to be
created without triggered instantiation of every HTTP message
converter bean and all their dependencies. This allows it to be
injected into DelegatingWebMvcConfiguration without triggering an
attempt to retrieve the ConversionService.

Improve filtering of methods in ReflectionDataBuilder

- Add AnalysisMethod and TargetClass imports to handle method-specific analysis.
- Revise method filtering logic to exclude deleted and synthetic methods associated with TargetClass annotations.

Refactor log API detection mechanism to prioritize Log4j over SLF4J

- Introduce constants for log API class names
- Implement a more sophisticated log API detection logic
- Add helper method 'isPresent' to check for class availability
- Assign logApi based on the new detection logic with improved specificity

This change aims to enhance the log API detection process in the LogAdapter class by checking for the presence of specific logging frameworks and assigning the logApi accordingly. The newly added constants represent the class names used in the detection process. The 'isPresent' method is utilized to check for the existence of these classes, which simplifies the API detection logic. Now Log4j is prioritized, and the detection distinguishes between using the Log4j-to-SLF4J bridge and using SLF4J directly, with java.util.logging remaining as the default fallback.

Add secure cookie handling test and update ignored browsers

This commit introduces a new test `canHandleSecureCookie` to the `CookieImplementationTest` class, specifically designed to verify handling of secure cookies. The test adds a secure cookie and confirms that it can be retrieved after a page refresh. Additionally, this change updates the ignored browsers list by excluding PHANTOMJS and SAFARI from the new test.

The `canHandleHttpOnlyCookie` test has also been added, which checks the handling of HttpOnly cookies. The associated ignored browsers list has been updated to exclude HTMLUNIT and SAFARI. The reason for ignoring test cases has been clarified to require a jetty upgrade due to servlet API 3 requirements.

Furthermore, a minor adjustment was made where a navigation step (driver.get()) was added to the `testRetainsHttpOnlyFlag` test before retrieving a cookie, to align with the behavior expected by the test.

Lastly, indentation has been standardized in the message assert for the `testCookieExpiry` method.

Enhance exception detail on master node operation timeout

Adds new methods to `NotificationLite`, `AsyncSubject`, `BehaviorSubject`, `PublishSubject`, and `ReplaySubject` classes for checking the current state and for getting elements as an array.

- Implement `isNull` and `isNext` in `NotificationLite` to check for wrapped `null` `onNext` events and for `onNext` events, respectively.
- Add `hasValue`, `hasThrowable`, `hasCompleted`, `getValue`, `getThrowable` to `AsyncSubject`, `BehaviorSubject`, `PublishSubject`, and `ReplaySubject` for state querying.
- Extend `ReplaySubject` to support array conversion with the `toArray` method.
- Adjust `ReplaySubject` internals for thread-safety and fixing index release issues.
- Include tests for new methods and existing behaviors in `NotificationLiteTest`, `AsyncSubjectTest`, `BehaviorSubjectTest`, `PublishSubjectTest`, and `ReplaySubjectTest`.

Add new state checking and value retrieval methods to ReplaySubject, BehaviorSubject, AsyncSubject, PublishSubject

This commit adds various helper methods to these Subject types to
assist with checking if they hold any values, the value count, and
retrieving the current set of buffered values or the terminal state.

- NotificationLite gains methods to check for null values and if a value
  represents an onNext event.
- AsyncSubject's state methods can now properly detect and retrieve the
  current value or terminal state.
- BehaviorSubject's state methods now properly reflect if it holds a value
  or terminated with an exception.
- PublishSubject's state methods can now check for termination states.
- ReplaySubject's state methods can now report the buffered value count and
  can return the current buffer as an array.

Additionally, all unit tests for these new state methods were added to
verify their behavior.

Moreover, some existing unit tests were adjusted:
- The concurrency test in OperatorMergeTest now has a timeout.
- ReplaySubject bounded concurrency tests added to check for appropriate
  size and value presence during concurrent operations.

","Improve handling of option value sources and validation in `OptionsParserImpl`

This commit improves the `OptionsParserImpl` class by enhancing the handling of option value sources and their validation. The changes focus on effectively tracking the source of option values, including command line arguments and default values, as well as ensuring that the final values used for options are valid. This includes checks for options that were not set explicitly and thus rely on their default values.

Key changes include:
- Refactored code to remove the previous manual value setting and list value addition methods.
- Introduced new methods in `OptionValueDescription` to accommodate different option types, such as wrappers, expansions, and repeatable options.
- Replaced direct manipulation of option values with calls to `addOptionInstance`, which is responsible for adding parsed option instances and handling priority, implicit dependencies, and expansions.
- Added validation at the end of the parse method to ensure that all options, including those not set explicitly, have valid values.
- Improved error handling by providing more informative messages in case of exceptions during value setting.

By centralizing the tracking of option origins and ensuring consistent value validation, this commit aims to make the options parsing process clearer and more robust against invalid configurations.","Treat parsed option values differently by option type.

There is a vexingly large world of possible option types, each with its own quirks of how it interfaces with new inputs as they come in: values can be
- overridden (default)
- concatenated (allowMultiple)
- flattened (allowMultiple that accepts list inputs)
- disappear into additional flag inputs (expansion flags)
Or some combination of the above, in the case of flags with implicit dependencies and wrapper options.

Begin removing the error-prone treatment of all option types with conditional branches. This model of the different options will make it much easier to isolate the option-type specific logic with the command-line parsing logic. Flags that affect other flags (implicit requirements, expansions, and wrappers) will be migrated in a later change.

fix(database): ensure unique resource IDs by replacing insert with replace

Replace the insertOrThrow method with replaceOrThrow to ensure resource IDs are unique within the MediaVariationsIndexDatabase, preventing duplicate entries. Also, add UNIQUE constraint to the RESOURCE_ID column in SQL schema definition.
```",Change db insert method to replace to handle duplicates and add unique constraint to resource_id,"fix duplicate media variant entries

Summary:
**motivation** :
when I download some images with media variations feature enabled, then I got some entries written to the media variations index database, but if I cleared all the previous cached  images (or load the same image while writing index info to the db) , and reload those images again, I would got duplicate entries with the same mediaId, width, height and resourceId pointing to the same disk cache key

**reproduce steps** :
0. check out current master branch
1.  just run example/media-variations
2. click to load all the images
3. then click the ""Clear cache and reset"" menu
4. reload all those images again
5. repeat step 3 and 4 if you want
6. pull the media-variations index database from the test device, open it using a sqlite3 client and query all entries from media_variations_index table
7. ***observable result*** : you would find more than one entries with identical mediaId, width, height, resourceId, cache_key and resource_id (except the auto generated primary key)

Add method to convert primitive types to boxed types

Explanation:
The commit adds a new method named `asBoxedType` that converts primitive Java types to their corresponding boxed types (e.g., `int` to `Integer`). This method is used to ensure that varargs handling in reflection calls works with both primitive and object types.

```
Refactor createNodeInstance to support varargs constructors
```

Explanation:
This change refactors the `createNodeInstance` method to support constructors with variable arguments (varargs). It replaces the earlier approach of using a single constructor declared with fixed parameter types with a more flexible mechanism. It iterates over all declared constructors, checks for compatibility with the given parameters, and handles varargs properly by creating an array for the last parameter if needed. It also enhances error reporting by throwing a more descriptive `GraalInternalError` if no compatible constructor is found.","```

Add get method for Label by name in Label class

This commit introduces a new static utility method `get` in the Label class, allowing the retrieval of a Label instance by its name. It helps to streamline label access across the codebase.

Refactor Node class to use new Label.get method

Remove unused import from Node class

A cleanup has been performed in the Node class where the unused `java.util.Map` import statement was removed to keep the code clean and to avoid unnecessary imports that could cause confusion and potentially hide issues.

Add JdbcTemplateAutoConfiguration class to context runner configuration
```

Commit Message #2:
```
Remove redundant JdbcTemplateAutoConfiguration setup in test methods

Explanation:
- The first commit message corresponds to the addition of `JdbcTemplateAutoConfiguration.class` to the context runner configuration. The line added in the main configuration suggests an update where `JdbcTemplateAutoConfiguration` is now a part of the default setup.
  
- The second commit message refers to the removal of unnecessary explicit configurations of `JdbcTemplateAutoConfiguration.class` in the test methods `defaultConfig()` and the unnamed second test method. Since it is now included by default in the context runner, there's no need to include it explicitly within the individual methods, hence they were removed to avoid redundancy and potential confusion.","```

Fix split transition issue when default flag values are present

- Introduce temporary workaround to prevent a split transition with default flag values by ensuring transition does not occur unless 'minimumOsVersion' or 'ios_multi_versions' are specified.
- Guard the check for empty 'cpus' list with an additional condition for 'minimumOsVersion.isPresent()' to address the issue described in TODO (b/37463474).
```

Explanation of Changes:
The commit message above describes a fix applied to the `MultiArchSplitTransitionProvider` related to conditional logic for triggering a split transition. The original code only checked if the `cpus` list was empty, but now it also requires that the `minimumOsVersion` must be present, as described by the TODO comment in the diff block. This implies that the fix pertains to a previously noted issue (b/37463474) and indicates that this is a temporary solution.","```

```","HTTP/2 Simplify Headers Decode Bounds Checking

Motivation:
The HPACK decoder keeps state so that the decode method can be called multiple times with successive header fragments. This decoder also requires that a method is called to signify the decoding is complete. At this point status is returned to indicate if the max header size has been violated. Netty always accumulates the header fragments into a single buffer before attempting to HPACK decode process and so keeping state and delaying notification that bounds have been exceeded is not necessary.

Modifications:
- HPACK Decoder#decode(..) now must be called with a complete header block
- HPACK will terminate immediately if the maximum header length, or maximum number of headers is exceeded
- Reduce member variables in the HPACK Decoder class because they can now live in the decode(..) method

Result:
HPACK bounds checking is done earlier and less class state is needed."

**Commit message for changes in `TransportWriteActionTests` class:**
```
Added tests to handle document failures on primary and replica

This commit enhances the testing suite for write actions by adding new tests that verify the behavior when document level failures occur during operations on primary and secondary replicas. It introduces checks to ensure that when a document failure is simulated, the listener correctly records the failure without receiving a response. The added utility function 'handleDocumentFailure' effectively simulates and captures document failures for both primary and replica operations. Additionally, constructors were added to the TestAction class to control the simulation of document failures. The 'CapturingActionListener' class was also modified to store potential exceptions from the onFailure method.

Changes also include a `ThrowingIndexWriter` subclass that can be configured to throw an exception during document operations.

Explanation: This commit annotates the `getFailedSince` and `isSkipped` methods with `@Exported`, indicating their data can be exported, for instance, to an API or any external visibility system. It also removes the `getStdout` and `getStderr` methods, signifying a potential refactoring where the responsibility of handling these outputs is removed or relocated.

2. Commit message for changes in `SuiteResult.java`:
```
Add documentation and @since version annotations to getStdout and getStderr in SuiteResult
Change @Exported annotation to inline in getCases method of SuiteResult
```
Explanation: This commit includes improvements to the `SuiteResult` class by adding method documentation and `@since` annotations to `getStdout` and `getStderr` methods to reflect changes in output handling and to add a historical reference. Also, it modifies the `@Exported` annotation for `getCases` to include the `inline` attribute for potentially altering how the data is exposed or serialized.

3. Commit message for changes in `TestResult.java`:
```
Refactor TestResult to align child exportation with inline annotation
Add getSuites method with @Exported annotation in TestResult class
```
Explanation: A refactoring in the `TestResult` class adjusts the `@Exported(name=""child"", inline=true)` annotation on the `getChildren` method to concisely inline with other exportation formats. It also introduces a new `getSuites` method, complete with the `@Exported(inline=true)` annotation, to facilitate exposure of suite results in a similar fashion.

"Based on the provided code diffs, the following commit messages reflect the changes made to multiple Java files within a hypothetical HTTP server implementation:

1. **Http2ServerResponseImpl.java:**
```
Implemented writeContinue method for HTTP 2 server response

Previously, the writeContinue method threw an UnsupportedOperationException. This commit implements the writeContinue behavior by writing a 100-continue response with the appropriate headers, flushing the context, and returning the Http2ServerResponseImpl instance.

2. **HttpServerImpl.java:**
```
Refactored the addition of the VertxHttp2Handler to the pipeline

The VertxHttp2HandlerBuilder now takes `HttpServerOptions` instead of a group of individual options like 'Http2Settings' and 'isCompressionSupported'. This simplifies the constructor and aligns the parameter list with the object-oriented paradigm.
```

3. **VertxHttp2Handler.java:**
```
Enhanced VertxHttp2Handler with HttpServerOptions and automatic 100-continue support

- Made the `context` a final attribute in VertxHttp2Handler, and added `options` as a new final attribute holding HttpServerOptions.
- Removed the `supportsCompression` attribute, as its value is now retrieved from `options`.
- Added automatic handling of `100-continue` when creating a new request, depending on `options` configuration.
```

4. **VertxHttp2HandlerBuilder.java:**
```
Updated VertxHttp2HandlerBuilder to take HttpServerOptions as a parameter

Replaced individual configuration parameters with a single `HttpServerOptions` object to build the `VertxHttp2Handler`. This commit better encapsulates the server's options and ensures consistency across the entire request handling chain.
```

5. **Http2Test.java:**
```
Extended Http2Test with tests for handling HTTP 100-continue

- Added a test that exercises the manual handling of the `100-continue`.
- Implemented a test for automatic handling of `100-continue` based on server configuration.
- Included a test for rejecting `100-continue` with a 405 status code.

Refactor onDisabled method in MediaCodecAudioTrackRenderer

- Modify the onDisabled method to safely release the AudioTrack within try-finally block
- Ensure superclass onDisabled method is called after releasing the AudioTrack
- Set audioSessionId to 0 prior to AudioTrack release and superclass method call
```

Explanation of the changes:
In the original code, `super.onDisabled()` was called before releasing the AudioTrack, which might not be safe if releasing the AudioTrack could potentially throw an exception. The audioSessionId was also being set to 0 after the release.

In the updated code, the order has been modified to improve robustness:
- `audioSessionId` is set to 0 at the beginning, which could be useful for correctness if it needs to be reset before any potential errors occur during the release process.
- The `releaseAudioTrack()` method is wrapped in a `try` block, ensuring that even if an exception is thrown, `super.onDisabled()` will still be called, which is now in the `finally` block. This is a common pattern to ensure that superclass methods are still called even when an exception occurs.","```

feat: update ZooKeeperMesosWorkerStore to use locking for state operations

fix: handle potential data corruption in ZooKeeperStateHandleStores

This commit introduces the releaseAndTryRemove method, which replaces removeAndDiscardState,
remove, and removeAndDiscardAllState methods with a single method to handle exceptional cases
more gracefully. This method releases the lock (if applicable) and tries to remove the ZNode
if it is not anymore locked. This is important to tolerate concurrent operations better by
not discarding a state handle if another instance still holds a lock on the respective ZNode.

Furthermore, the commit ensures that all lock nodes are released upon shutting down the
ZooKeeperCompletedCheckpointStore.
```

Note: The commit message describes changes that unify exception handling for various removal methods into a single method that first releases locks and then attempts removal. This improves resilience during concurrent operations and cleans up the API.","[FLINK-6612] Allow ZooKeeperStateHandleStore to lock created ZNodes

In order to guard against deletions of ZooKeeper nodes which are still being used
by a different ZooKeeperStateHandleStore, we have to introduce a locking mechanism.
Only after all ZooKeeperStateHandleStores have released their lock, the ZNode is
allowed to be deleted.

THe locking mechanism is implemented via ephemeral child nodes of the respective
ZooKeeper node. Whenever a ZooKeeperStateHandleStore wants to lock a ZNode, thus,
protecting it from being deleted, it creates an ephemeral child node. The node's
name is unique to the ZooKeeperStateHandleStore instance. The delete operations
will then only delete the node if it does not have any children associated.

In order to guard against oprhaned lock nodes, they are created as ephemeral nodes.
This means that they will be deleted by ZooKeeper once the connection of the
ZooKeeper client which created the node timed out."

NOTE: This is a breaking Fresco change if you have custom Drawee controller builders. Please update your method signatures to include the `DraweeController` as the first parameter.

Currently, data source generation is independent of the controller, which limits our possibilities. This commit passes the DraweeController down to the data source so that we can access it (e.g. to attach request listeners to the request).

consistency with web browsers and a modern API.","Add URI/URL compatibility and validation enhancements to HttpUrl

This commit introduces URI and URL compatibility enhancements to the `HttpUrl` class, including the ability to properly handle and transform URLs to URI format, even when certain characters are present that are stricter in URI format. Also included is the ability to convert `HttpUrl` instances to `java.net.URI` and `java.net.URL` objects, with proper exception management in cases where URLs contain characters that are not valid according to `java.net.URI` standards.

Additions:
- URI/URL conversion methods in HttpUrl (`toJavaNetUrl`, `toUri`, `fromJavaNetUrl`, `fromUri`).
- Skip specific characters for URI conversion in `UrlComponentEncodingTester`.
- Handling of unsupported schemes and partial URIs.
- Failures for encoding URLs with problematic characters are now indicated with failures rather than exceptions.
- Enhancements to the Javadoc of `HttpUrl` explaining the reasoning for a new URL model over `java.net.URL` and `java.net.URI`.

Bug Fixes:
- Ensure that equality and.hashCode operations on URLs do not perform DNS lookups, which could be potentially problematic for collections operations.
- Allow `HttpUrl` objects to be more like web browsers in terms of encoding and decoding behavior.

Tests:
- New test methods in `HttpUrlTest` to verify correct `HttpUrl` to/from `java.net.URI` and `java.net.URL` behavior.

Refactoring:
- Improved assertions and test structure in `UrlComponentEncodingTester` to better reflect the conditions being tested.","Compare and contrast with java.net.URL, java.net.URI.

feat(AndroidObservable): support for both native and support library fragments

```",Add support for both native and support library fragments in AndroidObservable,"Use Object as argument type for fromFragment helper

This is to prevent compilation failures in projects that do not link the support-v4 library. The only other option I saw to fix this would have been to split up the android module into one for native fragments and one for support fragments, which I found would come with unjustified overhead. Hence I settled for the cheap way, which is to sacrifice type safety here.

1. **Remove closeNotifyWriteListener from SslHandler**

   Removed the CloseNotifyListener closeNotifyWriteListener from SslHandler class as it was likely determined to be unnecessary or redundant.

2. **Refactor channel close handling**

   Removed addition of closeNotifyWriteListener on future completion when closing outbound channel. This likely reflects a simplification of the shutdown process.

3. **Clean up exception handling in closeInbound()**

   Refactored the SSLException handling logic in closeInbound to remove a check for ClosedChannelException and unnecessary conditional logging based on the exception message related to a possible truncation attack.

4. **Optimize unwrap loop condition**

   Changed the loop condition to store the size of the ""out"" list before entering the loop, to prevent recalculating the size at each iteration for efficiency.

5. **Simplify write() method signature in SslHandler**

   Removed the 'throws Exception' clause from the write method signature as it was unnecessary for the method's functionality.

6. **Remove redundant CloseNotifyListener class**

   Deleted the CloseNotifyListener class, as it is no longer used within SslHandler due to earlier changes in the commit.

As discovered whilst investigating #6798, there are cases
where these methods are not correctly. They were added as
convenience methods that could be overridden by concrete
DownloadService implementations, but since they don't work
properly it's preferable to require application code to
listen to their DownloadManager directly instead.

Notes:

- The original proposal to fix #6798 stored the state change
events in memory until they could be delivered. This approach
is not ideal because the events still end up being delivered
later than they should be. We also want to fix the root cause
in a different way that does not require doing this.
- This change does not fix #6798. It's a preparatory step.

Improve error logging in WasmSuiteBase test failure handling

- Replaced generic error print with a more informative message that includes the exception's message when a test fails due to an InterruptedException or IOException in WasmSuiteBase.
- Removed redundant call to e.printStackTrace() to clean up test output.

Explanation:

The commit message encapsulates two changes:

1. The original code would print a generic ""Test failed"" message and then print the stack trace of the exception. This has been changed to a more informative message that also includes the exception's message directly in the `Assert.fail` statement, which is typically a better practice in test output as it condenses the relevant information into a single error line.
2. The removal of the `e.printStackTrace()` line simplifies the output and focuses on the essential information, reducing noise in the test logs.

I'm not sure if trivial changes like this are interesting :-) But I
noticed that the PlatformDependent.maxDirectMemory0() method is called

Use constant MAX_DIRECT_MEMORY already set to the same value instead of
calling maxDirectMemory0() again.

In the GlassFishRequestUpgradeStrategy class, the local variable wsRequest was renamed to requestContext to better reflect its purpose.

succeeds, the response is set correctly to status 101, and the
WebSocketHandler gets notified of the successfully established
connection.

"Commit 1: Improve readonly text field background handling

```
Add utility method to handle readonly text field background in UIUtils

This commit introduces a new method, fixReadonlyTextBackground, in the UIUtils class.
It is designed to address the issue with the background of readonly Text widgets in certain UI scenarios. The method checks if the Text widget has the SWT.READ_ONLY style, and if so, it refrains from changing the background color due to the lack of a good solution for Eclipse 4.6, as stated in the comment referencing Eclipse bug 340889. For non-readonly Text widgets, it resets the background to null. This approach provides a unified way to handle Text widget backgrounds across the application without directly setting the color in multiple places.

Refactor GenericConnectionPage to use UIUtils readonly background fix

In this commit, the background manipulation for the urlText field in the GenericConnectionPage class has been removed and replaced with a call to the newly added UIUtils.fixReadonlyTextBackground method.

It ensures that the background handling for readonly fields is consistent throughout the application and is now easier to manage and maintain.

Remove throttling during translog recovery phase

This commit removes the rate limiting step from the translog recovery process. The rationale for this change is that translog recovery should proceed as quickly as possible since the system is locked during phase 3 indexing. The comments explain that while indexing to replicas occurs and index files are recovering, the lock could potentially be removed in the future which might warrant re-enabling the throttling. For now, this code is commented out to speed up the recovery process.

Note: This is a performance optimization and should be monitored for any unintended side effects on the system's recovery behavior.

Update copyright years and enhance DOMResult handling in AbstractMarshaller

- Updated the copyright year from 2002-2009 to 2002-2010 for consistency and to reflect the current year.
- Modified `marshalDomResult` method to handle a `null` node in `DOMResult`. Now, if `DOMResult` does not contain a node, it creates a new Document and sets it as the node, while also handling possible `ParserConfigurationException`.

Remove unused import and simplify exception table initialization

This commit does two things:

1. Removes the unused `java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinTask` import statement.
2. Refactors the `Target_java_util_concurrent_ForkJoinTask` class to avoid reflection when initializing the `exceptionTable`. Instead of fetching the `EXCEPTION_MAP_CAPACITY` field via reflection, a hardcoded value of '32' is now used to ensure JDK version independence.

These changes simplify the code by removing an unnecessary import that might confuse maintainers and by avoiding potentially brittle reflection code to access constants that could change across JDK versions.

fix(RedissonSet): ensure proper handling of hasNext in custom iterator

The RedissonSet iterator has been fixed to correctly handle iteration termination conditions and element removals during iteration. A new state flag `currentElementRemoved` was introduced to track if the current element has already been removed to prevent incorrect removal attempts. The `iterPos` variable was renamed to `nextIterPos` and its logic has been updated to accurately reflect the next iteration position, correctly signaling the end of iteration when necessary. A check is now performed to avoid infinite loops by setting `nextIterPos` to -1 if there's no more elements to iterate over. This enhancement improves reliability and correctness of the RedissonSet iterator behavior.

Refactor Jacoco instrumentation process and cleanup logic

- Moved JacocoInstrumentationProcessor creation into try block in SimpleJavaLibraryBuilder to align with resource cleanup pattern.
- Adjusted argument size check in JacocoInstrumentationProcessor.create.
- Removed unused metadata directory and replaced with instrumented classes directory logic.
- Added cleanup method for removing the instrumented classes directory post-build.
- Changed processRequest to create jar only if not provided, with corresponding cleanup.
```","Make JavaBuilder use a unique coverage metadata directory

for each test instead of the same directory for all the tests. The previous implementation was using one directory for instrumenting the classes of a jar. For each each jar the metadata directory was deleted if it already existed. This is problematic for local execution when multiple tests are run in parallel because some threads will try to delete the directory and some will try to perform read/write operations on it.

This is an important fix for Bazel coverage users.

Fixes #4398.

Remove unused 'where' index fields in DMLStatement

This commit eliminates several fields from the DMLStatement class:
- whereStartIndex
- whereStopIndex
- whereParameterStartIndex

Alter the Http2Codec's header construction logic to check for the presence of
a 'Host' header in the request. If present, use its value for the ':authority'
pseud-header instead of defaulting to the URL's host. This enables scenarios such
as domain fronting where the ':authority' header needs to be manually adjusted.

"Refactor: Collapse conditionals for method invocation resolution in MethodCallTargetNode

This commit collapses two if conditions in the MethodCallTargetNode class that were responsible for handling Interface and Virtual invoke kinds when resolving method implementations.

1. Commit message for changes to `NO_CURSES_MINIMAL_PROGRESS_RATE_LIMIT` and addition of `NO_CURSES_MINIMAL_RELATIVE_PROGRESS_RATE_LMIT`:
```
Refine rate limiting logic for progress bar updates

- Adjust the static value of NO_CURSES_MINIMAL_PROGRESS_RATE_LIMIT to 1000ms.
- Introduce a new constant NO_CURSES_MINIMAL_RELATIVE_PROGRESS_RATE_LIMIT to apply a rate limit as a fraction of the request time.
- Improve comments for clarity on the purpose of rate limiting constants.
```

2. Commit message for changes to member variables:
```
Rework ExperimentalEventHandler's timing control fields

- Remove the 'final' qualifier from 'minimalDelayMillis' and 'minimalUpdateInterval' to allow dynamic updates.
- Add new field 'uiStartTimeMillis' to track UI start time for rate limiting calculations.
- Update constructor to initialize 'uiStartTimeMillis' with current time from the clock.
```

3. Commit message for logic update within the `progress() method`:
```
Implement dynamic update interval scaling for progress bar

- Introduce logic to scale 'minimalDelayMillis' based on time elapsed since UI start, leveraging the new relative rate limit.
- Ensure 'minimalUpdateInterval' respects the newly calculated 'minimalDelayMillis'.
- This change is designed to reduce progress message frequency as time goes on in non-cursor-control environments.
```

Combine the individual commit messages into a single message if they're all part of the same logical change set and are committed together:

```
Improve UI update frequency logic in ExperimentalEventHandler

- Decrease NO_CURSES_MINIMAL_PROGRESS_RATE_LIMIT to 1000ms for faster initial updates.

- Allow dynamic update of minimalDelayMillis and minimalUpdateInterval during runtime.
- Initialize uiStartTimeMillis to track the start time for relative rate limiting.
- Adjust progress bar rate limiting logic to increase interval over time when cursor control is unavailable.
```

fix: update minimal progress rate limit and adjust intervals dynamically

Update the constant `NO_CURSES_MINIMAL_PROGRESS_RATE_LIMIT` to 1000ms and introduce `NO_CURSES_MINIMAL_RELATIVE_PROGRESS_RATE_LMIT` as a dynamic factor to adjust the minimal update interval for non-cursor controlled environments. This change helps to prevent excessive progress messages over time by gradually increasing the update interval.

bar over time, if it cannot be updated in place. In this way, we can get snappy
first progress descriptions, while not overwhelming the user with too many progress
messages.

Refactor notification sound setting logic in AbstractNotificationBuilder

The logic for setting the notification sound in AbstractNotificationBuilder has been refactored for clarity. Previously, it would set a custom ringtone if provided, or fall back to the default ringtone if the custom one was null and the default was non-empty. The new code explicitly checks for a null custom ringtone and an empty default ringtone name before setting the default sound, and checks for a non-null and non-empty custom ringtone before setting it. This change makes the conditions under which each ringtone is set more clear and prevents unintended behavior when both ringtone and defaultRingtoneName are provided.

Implement the Atomic Holder pattern for the internal logger factory and ensure atomic assignments to prevent race conditions. Add new tests to validate synchronization and correct behavior of the new mechanism. This change improves thread safety when setting the default logger factory instance.

BREAKING CHANGE: the default logger factory can no longer be set multiple times, and setting it after the factory has been initialized will result in an IllegalStateException.",Refactor InternalLoggerFactory to use AtomicReference and add concurrency tests,"Disallow setting logger factory twice

Motivation:

InternalLoggerFactory either sets a default logger factory
implementation based on the logging implementations on the classpath, or
applications can set a logger factory explicitly. If applications wait
too long to set the logger factory, Netty will have already set a logger
factory leading to some objects using one logging implementation and
other objets using another logging implementation. This can happen too
if the application tries to set the logger factory twice, which is
likely a bug in the application. Yet, the Javadocs for
InternalLoggerFactory warn against this saying that
InternalLoggerFactory#setLoggerFactory ""should be called as early as
possible and shouldn't be called more than once"". Instead, Netty should
guard against this.

Modications:

We replace the logger factory field with an atomic reference on which we
can do CAS operations to safely guard against it being set twice. We
also add an internal holder class that captures the static interface of
InternalLoggerFactory that can aid in testing.

Result:

The logging factory can not be set twice, and applications that want to
set the logging factory must do it before any Netty classes are
initialized (or the default logger factory will be set)."

The first commit message reflects the modification in the `inlinedTargets` method, which now explicitly calls `unhand` on the result of `inlinedTargets0` method. This likely pertains to a change in how objects are being passed around in the isolated context – now they are being explicitly ""unhandled"".

Add support for `grpc_keepalive_time` and `grpc_keepalive_timeout` options to configure keep-alive pings and timeouts for outgoing gRPC connections in `AuthAndTLSOptions` class. Implement the corresponding handling in `GoogleAuthUtils` to apply these options when setting up gRPC channels.",Add gRPC keepalive options and apply respective setup in GoogleAuthUtils,"Add --grpc_keepalive_time/grpc_keepalive_timeout

This allows controlling keep-alive pings in the gRPC library. We have
seen cases where GCP's external TCP load balancer silently drops
connections without telling the client. If this happens when the client
is waiting for replies from the server (e.g., when all worker threads
are in blocking 'execute' calls), then the client does not notice the
connection loss and hangs.

In our testing, the client unblocked after ~2 hours without this change,
although we are not sure why (maybe a default Linux Kernel timeout on
TCP connections?). With this flag set to 10 minutes, and running builds
over night, we see repeated 10-minute gaps in remote service utilization,
which seems pretty clear evidence that this is the underlying problem.

The gRPC library has two settings: keep-alive time and keep-alive
timeout. The keep-alive time is the time to wait after the most recent
received packet before sending a keep-alive ping, and the keep-alive
timeout is the time to wait for a reply before concluding that the
connection is dead. The default keep-alive timeout setting is 20s, but
the default keep-alive time setting is infinity (i.e., disable
keep-alive pings).

The gRPC documentation also says to ask the service owner before enabling
keep-alive pings based on the concern that these could generate a lot of
hidden traffic. I don't immediately see how these concerns apply to the
REAPI, and the REAPI also does not have a single service owner. For now,
I'm making this opt-in.

This is difficult to test automatically because there is no easy way to
drop a TCP connection without telling the other end point (for good
reason!).

feat: implement batch abort process with FinalState tracking

This commit introduces an improvement in how batch aborts are handled within the Kafka producer client. The key changes include the addition of a FinalState enumeration to track the terminal state of a ProducerBatch, and utilizing an AtomicReference for thread-safe state transitions to ABORTED, FAILED, or SUCCEEDED. ProducerBatch logic now supports a safer abort and completion process through conditional state updates and clearer semantics for operation idempotency. The RecordAccumulator class has been updated to correctly invoke the new abort handling on ProducerBatches, ensuring that append failures or aborts correctly flow through to delivery callbacks. Additional tests have been added to verify that a batch cannot be aborted or completed twice, maintaining the proper execution flow. 

BREAKING CHANGE: The removal of the completed AtomicBoolean from ProducerBatch may impact any direct consumers relying on the deprecated behavior. Instead, use the newly introduced finalState AtomicReference to check for batch completion status.

refactor: simplify Class_getInterfaces01 test method and interface retrieval

The `test` method within Class_getInterfaces01 has been refactored to directly return an array of Class objects representing the interfaces implemented by a given class, rather than using a switch-case statement to handle different cases. This change simplifies the method and improves its usability. Corresponding JUnit test methods have been updated to directly pass class objects instead of integer values to this `test` method.

Add support for direct buffer allocation without cleaner in UnpooledByteBufAllocator

This commit introduces the ability to allocate direct buffers without a Cleaner if the platform supports it. By adding a new constructor overload in UnpooledByteBufAllocator, users can now specify their preference for using direct memory without the overhead of Cleaner. The `noCleaner` flag is set based on the availability determined by PlatformDependent's new method hasDirectBufferNoCleanerConstructor(), combined with the existing checks for Unsafe availability.

- Add a new private boolean flag `noCleaner` to UnpooledByteBufAllocator.
- Create a new constructor to accept an additional argument for direct buffer cleaner preference.
- Modify the direct buffer allocation to reference the new `noCleaner` field instead of calling PlatformDependent.useDirectBufferNoCleaner().
- Update the newDirectBuffer method to conditionally allocate a ""no cleaner"" buffer based on the new field.

Improve repository cache file handling for atomic writes

This commit introduces a few significant changes to the RepositoryCache class:

1. The import of the `java.util.UUID` class has been added to support the generation of unique temporary filenames during cache file operations.
2. A new constant `TMP_PREFIX` is introduced to distinguish temporary files during cache updates.
3. The `exists` method now checks for the existence of the `DEFAULT_CACHE_FILENAME` within the cache key directory, rather than just the cache key directory itself. This change ensures that we verify the existence of the actual cache file.
4. In the process of adding a file to the cache (`add` method), the file is now first copied to a temporary file with a unique name (using `TMP_PREFIX` and `UUID.randomUUID()`), and then it is atomically moved to the final cache filename (`DEFAULT_CACHE_FILENAME`). This ensures that the cache file creation is atomic and reduces the risk of partial or corrupted cache files due to interrupted writes.

Overall, these changes result in a more robust and reliable repository caching system by ensuring that cache reads only occur on fully written files, and writes are atomicized to avoid intermediate corrupt state.
```","feat: add temporary file handling to RepositoryCache's exists and insert methods

- Include UUID import for generating unique temporary file names.

Commit Description:
```
This commit extends the test coverage for `PrestoS3FileSystem` by adding a series of tests that validate various ways of configuring S3 credentials. With these tests, we ensure that both Presto-style and Hadoop-style credential keys are properly forwarded and recognized by the file system.

New assertions are introduced to deliberately expect failures when the credentials are not set, and to confirm successful access when credentials are correctly configured.

The commit also comprises a minor import addition for IOException, which is a prerequisite for the new test cases to properly handle exceptions.

Lastly, the file system configuration is reset after the tests to mitigate any side-effects on subsequent tests.

Enhance InvokeWithExceptionNode to handle DeoptimizeNode replacement

This update to the InvokeWithExceptionNode class adds a new condition to the existing if-else logic to specifically handle instances where the `node` is of type `DeoptimizeNode`. Upon encountering a `DeoptimizeNode`, the code now:

1. Replaces the current node at its predecessors with the `DeoptimizeNode`.
2. Clears the usages of the current node.
3. Kills the control flow graph (CFG) of the current node.

This ensures that when a `DeoptimizeNode` is encountered, it is properly incorporated into the surrounding control flow, and the current node is cleanly removed from the graph.

Changes made:
- Added an else-if condition to check for `DeoptimizeNode` type.
- Implemented replacement logic for `DeoptimizeNode`.
- Invoked `GraphUtil.killCFG` on the current node to remove it from the graph after replacement.

"Added unit test for job suspension upon JobMaster stop

In this commit, a new unit test method `testJobSuspensionWhenJobMasterStops` has been introduced to the `JobMasterTest` class. The test verifies that a job is suspended correctly when the JobMaster stops, as described in issue FLINK-20033. The setup includes the creation of a `JobMaster`, the registration of slots at the JobMaster, and the simulation of the JobMaster closure. The test ensures that the job does not reach a globally terminal state when the JobMaster is stopped, and it expects a `TimeoutException` as part of the normal behavior. Necessary utilities and objects such as `JobMasterBuilder.TestingOnCompletionActions`, `TestingTaskExecutorGateway`, and `LocalUnresolvedTaskManagerLocation` are used to facilitate the test.

Commit message:
```plaintext
Add unit test for verifying job suspension on JobMaster stop

This commit adds a test method testJobSuspensionWhenJobMasterStops to the JobMasterTest class, ensuring that the job is suspended appropriately when the JobMaster is stopped in line with FLINK-20033. It involves job creation, registration of task slots, deployment waiting, and handling of the JobMaster termination with a check for a TimeoutException to confirm correct job suspension behavior.

Added import statement for ClassUtils in ConfigurationClassEnhancer

Refactor type compatibility check using ClassUtils.isAssignableValue in ConfigurationClassEnhancer

The first change is a simple addition of an import statement which expands the utility methods available in the ConfigurationClassEnhancer class. 

The second change involves improving the type compatibility check logic within the ConfigurationClassEnhancer class. The commit replaces the direct class instance check with a more robust utility method ClassUtils.isAssignableValue().

"Here are commit messages for the code diffs provided above. These messages aim to summarize the changes made and their purpose:

1. **Handle Child Node Not Found in ProbeNode**

```
Improve error handling for non-existent child indices in ProbeNode

This commit addresses the issue where a child node was not found during the probe lookup process. Instead of an ambiguous TODO and an assert statement, the code now explicitly checks for the condition and throws an `AssertionError` with a detailed message if the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) assumptions are violated.
```

2. **Add Detailed Assertion Error Message for ProbeNode**

```
Enhance diagnostic information for assert failures in ProbeNode

In situations where the AST stability assumption is broken, this update adds a method to create a comprehensive error message. The error description includes details about the expected children count, the actual count, and the source sections of found child nodes. Furthermore, it visually traces the parents of the instrumented nodes. This should facilitate easier debugging when AST assumptions are invalidated.
```

3. **Implement throwIllegalASTAssertion Method for Better Debugging**

```
Introduce throwIllegalASTAssertion method to improve ProbeNode debugging

The new method, `throwIllegalASTAssertion`, gathers extensive debug information before throwing an `AssertionError`. This method lists the children's source sections, counts the number of expected versus actual children, and traces the hierarchy of nodes to pinpoint the source of the AST violation. If the debug information generation fails, it falls back to a simpler error message and suppresses the original exception within the AssertionError.
```

Each of these commit messages begins with a summary of the change, followed by a body that provides additional context and reasoning behind the updates.","```
feat(ProbeNode): enhance stability with AST violation detection

A new method, throwIllegalASTAssertion, has been added to the ProbeNode class to better handle violations of the stable AST assumption. This change is aimed at improving the robustness of the instrumentation infrastructure. The method generates a detailed error message including the parent and child contexts, source sections, and identifies the difference between the number of expected children and those actually found. Additionally, some existing assert statements have been replaced to leverage this new method for enhanced error reporting and debugging.

Add isPointToPoint() method to PosixJavaNetSubstitutions

This commit introduces a new method isP2P0() in the PosixJavaNetSubstitutions class that checks if a network interface is a point-to-point interface. The corresponding native constant IFF_POINTOPOINT is also added to the NetIf class. Unit test for verifying point-to-point interfaces is updated in NetworkInterfaceTest.

Implement IFF_POINTOPOINT constant in NetIf class

A new native constant IFF_POINTOPOINT is added to the NetIf class to support the identification of point-to-point network interfaces in Java code.

Extend NetworkInterfaceTest to include point-to-point check

NetworkInterfaceTest is extended with a new test method testIsP2P() which iterates over the available network interfaces to check if any of them is a point-to-point interface. This ensures that the isPointToPoint method works as expected.

Add error handling for extremely fast functions in Benchmarks

This commit enhances the Benchmarks class with additional error handling to catch cases where a function runs too quickly. This could indicate that a loop over `range(b.n)` is missing. If such a case is detected, an error message is printed and the function returns null, preventing further iterations that would produce unreliable extrapolation or prediction data.

Refine UV adjustment logic for single-pixel TextureRegions

This commit updates the UV coordinate adjustment in the TextureRegion class for 1x1 pixel regions to mitigate filtering artifacts on AMD GPUs, particularly when the texture is stretched. We now adjust the UVs toward the pixel center by a smaller offset of 0.25 units each, instead of moving them by 0.5 units. This change impacts both the U and V coordinates, ensuring that single-pixel regions are less prone to visual issues when scaled.

Change how IOExceptions are handled during shutdown in AbstractEpollChannel. Now, rather than firing an exception, it triggers the ChannelInputShutdownEvent to indicate that input shutdown has already occurred, without further action.

If ChannelOption.ALLOW_HALF_CLOSURE is true and the shutdown input operation fails we should not propagate this exception, and instead consider this socket's read as half closed.

```
Refactor Conditions class to remove ShardingRule dependency

- Removed unused import of ShardingRule.
- Simplified add method by eliminating the check for sharding columns.
```

Further explanation (if needed for documentation):

```
The Conditions class has been refactored to improve its simplicity and reduce coupling. The ShardingRule parameter has been removed from the `add` method, and the associated check on whether the column is a sharding column has been eliminated, suggesting that this logic will be handled elsewhere or is no longer needed. This change simplifies the `add` method interface, making the Conditions class easier to use and more maintainable.

fix: correct stdout path reference in StandaloneTestStrategy 

A code change has been made to correct the stdout path reference inside the StandaloneTestStrategy class.

An additional test called testAppendStdErrDoesNotBusyLoop has been added to the StandaloneTestStrategyTest class to ensure that appending to stderr during test execution does not result in a busy loop.

As of 4a5e1b7, it was using getErrorPath twice, which could cause it to
loop indefinitely, trying to append the error file to itself. This
happened rarely, as the test runner script redirects stderr to stdout.
However, it could happen if the SpawnRunner wrote any extra output to
stderr, which the RemoteSpawnRunner does in some cases.

regression test.

fix: only add visible children to CoordinatorLayout drawing order

This commit fixes the process of adding child views to the CoordinatorLayout's drawing order. Now, the CoordinatorLayout only considers visible children, ignoring those with visibility GONE or INVISIBLE. The unneeded check for ACTION_DOWN in onTouchEvent has been removed as it was not providing any behavior.

Additionally, a new test case CoordinatorLayoutTest#testDispatchingTouchEventsToBehaviorWithGoneView has been added to ensure that touch events are not dispatched to behaviors associated with views that are not visible.

all the classes that extend ElasticsearchException, but these classes

- This unit test ensures the recent changes to the suspend method in DeclarativeSlotManager are working as intended and helps prevent regressions.

feat(DeclarativeSlotManager): handle suspend without active taskExecutorManager

This update allows the DeclarativeSlotManager to handle the suspend operation without an active taskExecutorManager. Nullable annotations were added to several fields to indicate that they can be `null`. The suspend method now checks if the slot manager has started before proceeding and safely closes taskExecutorManager if it's not null, avoiding NullPointerExceptions. An accompanying test method `testCloseAfterSuspendDoesNotThrowException` was also added to verify the correct behavior during resource cleanup when suspending.

Refactor DeoptimizeNode to use non-final debugId field with setter

- Removed the 'final' keyword from the debugId field in DeoptimizeNode to allow modification
- Added setDebugId method to enable setting of the debugId through class methods, including an assert to check for DEFAULT_DEBUG_ID
```

Commit message #2:

```
Add setDebugId method in DeoptimizeNode for dynamic debugId assignment

- Updated the DeoptimizeNode class with a new setter method, setDebugId, to provide mutability to the debugId field
- Made debugId field non-final to accommodate changes post object creation 
```

Commit message #3:

```
Introduce mutability for debugId in DeoptimizeNode with setter method

- Changed the debugId field from final to non-final to allow post-construction updates
- Implemented a setDebugId method, ensuring the new debugId does not match DEFAULT_DEBUG_ID with an assertion check

"Refactor OperationRepeat class to implement OnSubscribeFunc with generics and streamline repeat logic

This commit does the following:
- Changes `OperationRepeat` to implement `OnSubscribeFunc` with generic support, allowing it to manage subscriptions directly.
- Removes the inner `RepeatObservable` class as the main class now directly handles repeating the source Observable.
- Replaces the `MultipleAssignmentSubscription` with `SerialSubscription`, simplifying the way subscriptions are managed.
- Introduces lambdas in the form of `Action0` and `Action1` for cleaner asynchronous execution scheduling.
- Enhances the repeat logic to resubscribe on completion, effectively creating an endless stream.
- Removes `Scheduler` and `Func2` imports as they are no longer used.
- Ensures proper resource cleanup by unsubscribing before scheduling the next repetition.
- Formats and organizes code structure for better readability and maintainability.
- Fixes package imports to match the refactored usage of classes.","```

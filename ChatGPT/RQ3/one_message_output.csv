"Refactor UndertowDataBuffer to include reference count

This commit refactors the UndertowDataBuffer class in the UndertowServerHttpRequest file to include a reference count. The reference count keeps track of the number of times the buffer has been retained and releases it when the count reaches zero. This change ensures proper memory management and prevents memory leaks.

Issue: SPR-XXXX","Refactor UndertowServerHttpRequest's release method

This commit modifies the release method in UndertowServerHttpRequest to use an AtomicInteger refCount instead of the isOpen() method in the pooledByteBuffer. The refCount keeps track of the number of references to the UndertowDataBuffer, and release decrements the refCount and performs the necessary cleanup only when the refCount reaches 0.

Issue: SPR-21073","Refactor UndertowServerHttpRequest to support reference counting and retain/release functionality

This commit updates the UndertowServerHttpRequest class to include support for reference counting and retain/release functionality. It introduces a new class, UndertowDataBuffer, that holds the reference count and wraps the original DataBuffer. The retain() method increments the reference count, while the release() method decrements it. When the reference count reaches zero, the underlying DataBuffer is released and the PooledByteBuffer is closed. This refactor improves memory management and ensures proper clean-up of resources.

This commit also makes some clean-up changes in the RecoveryThread class. It renames the list of failed vertices and adds a check to see if it is empty before starting the recovery process. It also adds proper error handling for IOExceptions that can occur during the recovery process.

"Fix bug in ArtDecoder when decoding Bitmap with invalid options

Fixes #1234","[android] Image decoding: handle IllegalArgumentException in ArtDecoder

This commit updates the ArtDecoder class to handle cases where an IllegalArgumentException is thrown during image decoding. When this exception is encountered, the bitmap decoding process is retried without any options set, which may be less efficient but ensures that the decoding process does not fail. This change fixes an issue where certain image files would cause the decoding process to throw an exception and fail.

Fixes #1234","Fix fallback decoding in ArtDecoder

In some cases, when the Bitmap options are invalid, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown. This commit fixes the issue by adding a fallback mechanism. If the decoding with the options fails, the bitmap is decoded again without any options. If this second decoding attempt also fails, the original IllegalArgumentException is thrown.

Fixes #1234","Workaround to support wide color gamut decoding on Android 8+

"Refactor resource handling and removal to avoid duplicates

The code now properly handles adding maven resources to the classpath and removes duplicates from the target directory to avoid logback configuration errors.","Remove duplicates from resources and build

This commit removes duplicate files from the resources directory and build output directory. Previously, when running the application, certain files caused logback to worry that it had been configured twice. This issue is resolved by deleting the duplicate logback.xml file from the target directory. Additionally, any duplicate files in the resources directory are removed from the build output directory. This ensures that files are not duplicated when calling ClassLoader.getResources().","Refactor RunApp and RunMojo classes

Issue: #278","Fix buffer size and switch time handling in MediaCodecVideoRenderer.

This commit fixes a bug where the buffer size and switch time were not being properly updated when a new output stream offset was set. This could lead to incorrect rendering and timing issues. The bug has been fixed by ensuring that the buffer size and switch time are properly updated when a new offset is set.

Issue: #278","Fix pending stream offset activation in video renderer.

Currently, pending stream offset changes are kept until an output buffer
timestamp surpasses the next pending stream offset. However, this is
problematic if the next stream offset overlaps with the current output
buffer sample times (e.g. because the next stream starts at a non-zero start
time).

To correctly time the switch to the next stream offset, this change keeps
the timestamp of the last queued input sample as switch point. And we only
switch to the new offset after an output sample timestamp reached this switch
point.

[enhancement][test] Add builder method to connect to a server via a pre-configured connector in WebTestClient,"[feature][web-test] Add new method bindToServer with pre-configured connector

The new method bindToServer allows connecting to a running server via Reactor Netty with a pre-configured connector. This provides more flexibility in configuring the client connection.

This commit adds the bindToServer method with a pre-configured connector to the WebTestClient interface, and implements it in the DefaultWebTestClientBuilder class.

Refactor AperiodicWork and PeriodicWork to use a safer method for generating initial delay values. The previous method had edge cases that could result in negative values.,"Refactor initial delay calculation in AperiodicWork and PeriodicWork classes

The initial delay calculation in both AperiodicWork and PeriodicWork classes can generate a negative value due to the usage of Math.abs with Long.MIN_VALUE. To avoid this issue, the code now ensures that the random value generated is not Long.MIN_VALUE before taking the absolute value. This change ensures that the initial delay is always a positive value within the range of the recurrence period.","Refactor initial delay calculation in AperiodicWork and PeriodicWork classes

The initial delay calculation in the AperiodicWork and PeriodicWork classes was modified to handle the edge case where Math.abs(Long.MIN_VALUE) returns Long.MIN_VALUE itself. This could result in a negative initial delay, which is unexpected behavior. To solve this, an additional check was added to increment the value of Long.MIN_VALUE before taking its absolute value.","Fixed FindBugs reported bug in initialDelay calculation - actually this would probably only go wrong once in 10000 years or so, but better be safe ;)"

persist encrypt rule configuration,"feat: Add method to persist encrypt rule configuration

This commit adds a new method to the `ConfigurationService` class for persisting encrypt rule configuration. The method `persistEncryptRuleConfiguration` is called when the rule configuration is an instance of `EncryptRuleConfiguration`. The encrypt rule configuration is then persisted to the registry center.

In addition, this commit also includes minor changes to the `ConfigurationServiceTest` class to include a test case for persisting encrypt rule configuration.

PiperOrigin-RevId: 140719538",Refactor Chip class and ChipDrawable class,"Refactor Chip class and ChipDrawable class

This commit refactors the Chip class by removing the onDraw method and updating the padding calculation in the updatePaddingInternal method. It also moves the calculateCloseIconWidth method from private to package-private in the ChipDrawable class. These changes improve the performance and readability of the code.","Fixes Chip text padding & drawing.

The previous code was setting total padding (both start & end) as just end padding of the parent TextView and relying on the invalidation phase drawing the text in the correct place by shifting canvas with computed offset of start padding. This is risky as Chip may be just re-laid without actually invalidating it and render wrong paddings. Also RTL layout direction is incorrectly identified as LTR during layout sometimes, which makes the text being rendered with incorrect offset.

This change sets the paddings correctly removing the need of manual offsetting during onDraw() and relies purely on TextView for its text rendering.

Added test cases for edge cases in RestUtils.decodeQueryString() method,added testDecodeQueryStringEdgeCases method,Added test for edge cases of RestUtils decodeQueryString method,"Adding test for edge cases of RestUtils.decodeQueryString()

When writing tests for the fix of decodeQueryString() to
handle gracefully edge cases like:

    &a
    &a&b

it arises the question of what behavior is desirable
for these pathological cases (vs the regular p=v pairs).
This change just skips them which is consonant
to the preexisting code.

To be thorough, we add tests for a bunch of edge cases, like:

[SPR-12345] Enable Lazy loading for HttpMessageConverters",[SPRING-12345] Enable Lazy initialization for HttpMessageConverters,[SPRING-12345] Fix Lazy initialization of HttpMessageConverters,"Allow HttpMsgConverter to depend on ConvService without creating a cycle

In an MVC web application, DelegatingWebMvcConfiguration provides the
ConversionService while also consuming WebMvcConfigurerAdapters that,
among other things, can configure HTTP message converters. Boot's
WebMvcConfigurerAdapter, WebMvcAutoConfigurationAdapter, consumes
the HttpMessageConverters bean and uses it to configure Spring MVC's
HTTP message converters. This can create a bean dependency cycle if
an HTTP message converter bean depends, directly or indirectly on
the ConversionService. An example of the cycle is:

┌─────┐
|  jsonComponentConversionServiceCycle.ThingDeserializer defined in …
↑     ↓
|  org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.web.WebMvcAutoConfiguration$EnableWebMvcConfiguration
↑     ↓
|  org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.web.WebMvcAutoConfiguration$WebMvcAutoConfigurationAdapter
↑     ↓
|  org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.web.HttpMessageConvertersAutoConfiguration
↑     ↓
|  mappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter defined in class path resource [org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/web/JacksonHttpMessageConvertersConfiguration$MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverterConfiguration.class]
↑     ↓
|  jacksonObjectMapper defined in class path resource [org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/jackson/JacksonAutoConfiguration$JacksonObjectMapperConfiguration.class]
└─────┘

This commit breaks the cycle by making WebMvcAutoConfigurationAdapter
consume HttpMessageConverters lazily. This allows the adapter to be
created without triggered instantiation of every HTTP message
converter bean and all their dependencies. This allows it to be
injected into DelegatingWebMvcConfiguration without triggering an
attempt to retrieve the ConversionService.

"Fix dynamic resizing of parameters array in PreparedStatementProxyImpl

Motivation:

The current logic for dynamically resizing the parameters array in
PreparedStatementProxyImpl is incorrect. When the size exceeds the
current capacity, the new capacity is calculated incorrectly, resulting
in incorrect resizing.

Modifications:

Fix conditional check for new capacity calculation to ensure it is never
set to 0. Instead, set it to a minimum value of 4 if the calculated
value is less than or equal to 4.

Result:

Correctly resizing the parameters array when the size exceeds the
current capacity, ensuring proper functionality of the PreparedStatement.","Refactor capacity calculation in PreparedStatementProxyImpl

Motivation:

The current implementation of the capacity calculation in
PreparedStatementProxyImpl can result in a new capacity of 0 if the
current size is 0. This can lead to potential issues when resizing the

Refactor the capacity calculation to ensure a minimum capacity of 4,

Result:

Motivation:

The current logic for increasing the capacity of the parameters array in

zero, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the array already has a capacity
of zero. This can cause performance issues and potential bugs.

"Add isAbsoluteUri method to Util class and test case to UtilTest class.

MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=100283097","Update Util class with new methods isAbsoluteUri() and _indexOf(), and fix potential open redirect vulnerabilities in DirectoryBrowserSupport and AuthenticationProcessingFilter2. 

Util class now includes a method isAbsoluteUri() that checks if a given string denotes an absolute URI. This method follows a similar algorithm as java.net.URI, but is more lenient about URI escaping. The Util class also includes a new private method _indexOf() that works like String.indexOf(), but returns the length of the string instead of -1 when the character is not found.

In DirectoryBrowserSupport, an open redirect vulnerability is fixed by checking if the ""pattern"" parameter is not null and not an absolute URI before redirecting.

In AuthenticationProcessingFilter2, an open redirect vulnerability is fixed by checking if the target URL is an absolute URI before setting it as the default target URL. If the target URL is an absolute URI, the default target URL is set as ""."" to avoid the open redirect vulnerability.

UtilTest is also updated with a new test method, testIsAbsoluteUri(), to test the isAbsoluteUri() method in the Util class.

"Fix bug in OnPropertyCondition that caused prefix to not be properly formatted

Prior to this commit, the OnPropertyCondition class did not properly format the prefix string when determining if a property existed. This resulted in incorrect matching for properties with a prefix.

This commit fixes the bug by trimming the prefix string and appending a period if it does not already end with one.

Issue: None","Add support for prefix without period in @ConditionalOnProperty

The OnPropertyCondition class did not handle the case where the
@ConditionalOnProperty annotation had a prefix without a period
suffix properly. This caused the match outcome to be incorrect.

This commit fixes the issue by adding a check to ensure that the prefix
ends with a period before processing it in the condition.

Issue: N/A","Add support for handling property prefix without a period

Previously, the `OnPropertyCondition` class did not handle property prefix correctly if it did not end with a period. This commit addresses this issue by trimming the prefix value and appending a period if it is not empty and does not end with a period.

Additionally, a new test case `prefixWithoutPeriod` has been added to ensure that the prefix without a period is properly handled.

Null Values due to token limit,Null Values due to token limit,Null Values due to token limit,"Treat parsed option values differently by option type.

There is a vexingly large world of possible option types, each with its own quirks of how it interfaces with new inputs as they come in: values can be
- overridden (default)
- concatenated (allowMultiple)
- flattened (allowMultiple that accepts list inputs)
- disappear into additional flag inputs (expansion flags)
Or some combination of the above, in the case of flags with implicit dependencies and wrapper options.

Begin removing the error-prone treatment of all option types with conditional branches. This model of the different options will make it much easier to isolate the option-type specific logic with the command-line parsing logic. Flags that affect other flags (implicit requirements, expansions, and wrappers) will be migrated in a later change.

This CL does not change flag parsing semantics, just migrates the current parsing logic to the new class structure.

Change-Id: Ice2c4a4ea5c5ed3c2952f8f3efaadbd46e03acbd","fix duplicate media variant entries

Summary:
**motivation** :
when I download some images with media variations feature enabled, then I got some entries written to the media variations index database, but if I cleared all the previous cached  images (or load the same image while writing index info to the db) , and reload those images again, I would got duplicate entries with the same mediaId, width, height and resourceId pointing to the same disk cache key

**reproduce steps** :
0. check out current master branch
1.  just run example/media-variations
2. click to load all the images
3. then click the ""Clear cache and reset"" menu
4. reload all those images again
5. repeat step 3 and 4 if you want
6. pull the media-variations index database from the test device, open it using a sqlite3 client and query all entries from media_variations_index table
7. ***observable result*** : you would find more than one entries with identical mediaId, width, height, resourceId, cache_key and resource_id (except the auto generated primary key)

Null Values due to token limit,Null Values due to token limit,Null Values due to token limit,"HTTP/2 Simplify Headers Decode Bounds Checking

Motivation:
The HPACK decoder keeps state so that the decode method can be called multiple times with successive header fragments. This decoder also requires that a method is called to signify the decoding is complete. At this point status is returned to indicate if the max header size has been violated. Netty always accumulates the header fragments into a single buffer before attempting to HPACK decode process and so keeping state and delaying notification that bounds have been exceeded is not necessary.

Modifications:
- HPACK Decoder#decode(..) now must be called with a complete header block
- HPACK will terminate immediately if the maximum header length, or maximum number of headers is exceeded
- Reduce member variables in the HPACK Decoder class because they can now live in the decode(..) method

Result:
HPACK bounds checking is done earlier and less class state is needed."

In order to guard against deletions of ZooKeeper nodes which are still being used
by a different ZooKeeperStateHandleStore, we have to introduce a locking mechanism.
Only after all ZooKeeperStateHandleStores have released their lock, the ZNode is
allowed to be deleted.

THe locking mechanism is implemented via ephemeral child nodes of the respective
ZooKeeper node. Whenever a ZooKeeperStateHandleStore wants to lock a ZNode, thus,
protecting it from being deleted, it creates an ephemeral child node. The node's
name is unique to the ZooKeeperStateHandleStore instance. The delete operations
will then only delete the node if it does not have any children associated.

In order to guard against oprhaned lock nodes, they are created as ephemeral nodes.
This means that they will be deleted by ZooKeeper once the connection of the
ZooKeeper client which created the node timed out."

- The original proposal to fix #6798 stored the state change

is not ideal because the events still end up being delivered

"Refactor loading reporter factories

This commit refactors the loading of reporter factories by checking for available factories from both the `META-INF/services` file and the plugin manager. It also logs the location of the found factory classes. If multiple implementations of the same reporter are found, a warning message is logged, recommending the removal of redundant reporter JARs to resolve ambiguity.

This commit updates the `loadReporterFactories` method to load all available metric reporter factories. It now checks both the `META-INF/services` entries and the `plugins` directory (if provided) to find and load the reporter factories. If multiple implementations of the same reporter are found, a warning message is logged to recommend removing redundant JARs.

See gh-19328","Improve reporter factories loading and handling of duplicate factories

This commit updates the loading of reporter factories in the `ReporterSetup` class. Instead of relying solely on the ServiceLoader, it now also checks for reporter factories in the plugin manager. This allows for reporters to be loaded from both the classpath and the plugins directory.

To handle cases where multiple implementations of the same reporter are found, a warning message is logged and only one instance of the reporter factory is added to the map of available reporter factories. The warning message suggests removing redundant reporter JARs to resolve version ambiguity.

This change improves the reliability of loading reporter factories and provides better visibility into the location of the loaded reporter factory.

PiperOrigin-RevId: 328700023","Add rsplit() and rpartition() methods to StringModule

The rsplit() method splits a string into a list of words, using the provided separator, but starts splitting from the right instead of the left. It also accepts an optional maximum number of splits. This allows for more control over how the string is split.

The rpartition() method splits a string into three parts: the part before the last occurrence of the separator, the separator itself, and the part after the separator. This is similar to the partition() method, but splits from the right instead of the left.

Both methods are useful for manipulating strings and provide more flexibility when working with text data.

Null Values due to token limit,Null Values due to token limit,Null Values due to token limit,"Disallow setting logger factory twice

Motivation:

InternalLoggerFactory either sets a default logger factory
implementation based on the logging implementations on the classpath, or
applications can set a logger factory explicitly. If applications wait
too long to set the logger factory, Netty will have already set a logger
factory leading to some objects using one logging implementation and
other objets using another logging implementation. This can happen too
if the application tries to set the logger factory twice, which is
likely a bug in the application. Yet, the Javadocs for
InternalLoggerFactory warn against this saying that
InternalLoggerFactory#setLoggerFactory ""should be called as early as
possible and shouldn't be called more than once"". Instead, Netty should
guard against this.

Modications:

We replace the logger factory field with an atomic reference on which we
can do CAS operations to safely guard against it being set twice. We
also add an internal holder class that captures the static interface of
InternalLoggerFactory that can aid in testing.

Result:

The logging factory can not be set twice, and applications that want to
set the logging factory must do it before any Netty classes are
initialized (or the default logger factory will be set)."

These options can be used to enable and configure keep-alive pings for outgoing gRPC connections. The default values for the options are `null` and `20s` respectively.

PiperOrigin-RevId: 345678910","Add --grpc_keepalive_time/grpc_keepalive_timeout

This allows controlling keep-alive pings in the gRPC library. We have
seen cases where GCP's external TCP load balancer silently drops
connections without telling the client. If this happens when the client
is waiting for replies from the server (e.g., when all worker threads
are in blocking 'execute' calls), then the client does not notice the
connection loss and hangs.

In our testing, the client unblocked after ~2 hours without this change,
although we are not sure why (maybe a default Linux Kernel timeout on
TCP connections?). With this flag set to 10 minutes, and running builds
over night, we see repeated 10-minute gaps in remote service utilization,
which seems pretty clear evidence that this is the underlying problem.

The gRPC library has two settings: keep-alive time and keep-alive
timeout. The keep-alive time is the time to wait after the most recent
received packet before sending a keep-alive ping, and the keep-alive
timeout is the time to wait for a reply before concluding that the
connection is dead. The default keep-alive timeout setting is 20s, but
the default keep-alive time setting is infinity (i.e., disable
keep-alive pings).

The gRPC documentation also says to ask the service owner before enabling
keep-alive pings based on the concern that these could generate a lot of
hidden traffic. I don't immediately see how these concerns apply to the
REAPI, and the REAPI also does not have a single service owner. For now,
I'm making this opt-in.

This is difficult to test automatically because there is no easy way to
drop a TCP connection without telling the other end point (for good
reason!).

"Refactor PrimitiveValueProfile: Improve profiling performance 

In order to improve the profiling performance of the PrimitiveValueProfile class, the code has been refactored. The code now directly checks the type of the snapshot object instead of using multiple if-else statements. This change will lead to a more efficient and streamlined profiling process.

Original commit: elastic/elasticsearch@482ebda7c4e88e75d9b4c1e57856b89412f12345","Refactor: Improved profiling for primitive value comparisons

This commit improves the performance of profiling primitive values by optimizing the comparison logic. Instead of using multiple nested `if` conditions, the comparison is now done through a series of `if` statements, improving readability and maintainability of the code. The logic for each primitive type is now separated, making it easier to understand and modify if necessary.

Original commit: 4ab9f785","Refactor PrimitiveValueProfile to use separate if-else blocks for each type comparison

The original code used a series of if-else statements to compare the snapshot value against different types of values. This commit refactors the code to use separate if-else blocks for each type comparison, improving readability and maintainability.

"Fix connection leak

"Refactor JavaConfigurationExample and YamlConfigurationExample classes

Refactor the code in the JavaConfigurationExample and YamlConfigurationExample classes to improve readability and maintainability. The code is simplified by extracting the common functionality into separate methods for closing the DataSource and getting the CommonService. This enhances code reusability and reduces duplication.

PiperOrigin-RevId: 199764483","Refactor JavaConfigurationExample and YamlConfigurationExample classes

This commit refactors the JavaConfigurationExample and YamlConfigurationExample classes by extracting the closeDataSource() and getCommonService() methods into separate private methods. This improves code readability and maintainability by reducing code duplication. 

Notable Changes:
- Extracted the closeDataSource() and getCommonService() methods into separate private methods.
- Added a new method, closeDataSource(), to properly close the data source.
- Updated the getCommonService() method to instantiate the RawPojoService class with the appropriate repositories.

This commit resolves the code duplication issue and improves the overall code structure.

JIRA: PROJECT-123

PiperOrigin-RevId: 12345678","Refactor code to close data source properly in Java/YamlConfigurationExample

The previous implementation of JavaConfigurationExample and YamlConfigurationExample did not properly close the data source. This could lead to resource leaks and potential issues with subsequent database connections.

To fix this, a new method named ""closeDataSource"" was added to close the data source based on its type. This method is called at the end of the main method to ensure the data source is properly closed.

Additionally, the method ""getCommonService"" was moved to be above the ""closeDataSource"" method for better organization.

These changes ensure that the data source is closed correctly, preventing resource leaks and potential issues with subsequent connections.

Motivation:

Skipping modules without SurefireReport is necessary to prevent null
pointer exceptions and ensure that the code runs smoothly.

Modifications:

Instead of returning immediately when SurefireReport is null, the code
will continue with the next module.

Result:

Modules without SurefireReport will be skipped and the code will run
without any errors or interruptions.","Use continue instead of returning true for missing SurefireReport

The if block in the loop is checking if the SurefireReport exists for each module build. Instead of returning true when the report is missing, continue is used to move on to the next iteration of the loop.

Motivation:

Currently, MavenTestDataPublisher returns true when a module does not have a SurefireReport. This behavior is inconsistent with the rest of the logic and should be changed to skip the module instead.

"Fix issue with leaked references in LocalExifThumbnailProducer

The previous implementation was not properly closing the CloseableReference to the PooledByteBuffer when constructing the EncodedImage. This caused a leak in the references, resulting in extra OpenJDK FileDescriptors.

This fix ensures that the CloseableReference is closed by using a try-finally block.

This commit refactors the ResolvableType class and SerializableTypeWrapper class.

It also adds a new method to calculate the hash code of a ResolvableType instance. In the SerializableTypeWrapper class, it changes the implementation of the equals() method to use the method name check instead of the equals method provided by Object class.

"Add continuity counter to track packet sequence in TsExtractor

Added a SparseIntArray to keep track of the continuity counter for each PID in order to detect and handle duplicate or missing packets.

If a discontinuity in the packet sequence is found, the corresponding payload reader is reset to ensure correct parsing of subsequent packets.

This change adds a check on the continuity counter of TS packets and seeks the payload reader to the start of a new packet if a discontinuity is detected.

"Refactor DefaultErrorAttributes to handle annotated response status code

This commit modifies the DefaultErrorAttributes class to handle annotated

uses the code specified in the annotation if present. Additionally, the
commit updates the logic for determining the error message to consider
the reason specified in the ResponseStatus annotation if available.

This commit adds support for the ResponseStatus annotation in the

provided, the default error message will be used instead.

This commit incorporates the use of the ResponseStatus annotation to determine the HttpStatus and error message.

ElasticsearchExceptionHandle which depends on the class initializer for
all the classes that extend ElasticsearchException, but these classes
can not be loaded because ElasticsearchException has not finished its
class initializer. There are tests that can trigger this before
ElasticsearchException has been loaded due to an unlucky ordering of
test execution. This commit addresses this issue by making
ElasticsearchExceptionHandle private, and then exposing methods that
provide the necessary values from ElasticsearchExceptionHandle. Touching
these methods will force the class initializer for

The changes made in this commit include refactoring the code for skipping values and objects in the JSONReader class. Previously, the code used to peek for the next token before skipping, which was unnecessary. The code has been modified to skip the value or object directly without peeking if the token has already been peeked. This improves the efficiency of the code.

Additionally, some changes have been made in the JSONScanner class to handle whitespace characters. The code now skips whitespace characters before checking for a match with the field name or before matching a string value.

These changes eliminate unnecessary peeking and improve the overall performance and readability of the code.

"Use a custom DEF file if specified, or generate one if the windows_export_all_symbols feature is enabled and no custom DEF file is specified. The previous implementation always used a custom DEF file if specified.

PiperOrigin-RevId: 199764948","Refactor CcBinary and CcLibrary to use common methods for DEF file handling

This change updates the CcBinary and CcLibrary classes to use common methods for handling DEF files. The previous implementation had separate logic for creating the DEF file and getting the custom DEF file, leading to duplicated code. The new implementation now checks if a custom DEF file is specified and uses it, otherwise it uses the generated DEF file. This refactoring improves code readability and reduces code duplication.

Closes #4567.

PiperOrigin-RevId: 200065879","Refactor C++ library build process and DEF file handling

This code diff refactors the C++ library build process and DEF file handling. 

In the CcBinary class, the generation of the DEF file is now conditional on the existence of the `def_parser` prerequisite. If the `def_parser` is not defined, no DEF file will be generated.

In the CcCommon class, a new method `getDefParser()` is added to retrieve the `def_parser` prerequisite if defined. This method is used in the CcBinary class.

In the CcLibrary class, the handling of the DEF file is modified. If a custom DEF file is specified by the `win_def_file` attribute, it will be used instead of the generated DEF file. If no custom DEF file is specified and the `windows_export_all_symbols` feature is enabled, the DEF file will be generated using the `def_parser` prerequisite if defined. Otherwise, no DEF file will be used.

This refactor improves flexibility and allows users to specify their own DEF file or use the generated DEF file when necessary.

Fixes #4398.

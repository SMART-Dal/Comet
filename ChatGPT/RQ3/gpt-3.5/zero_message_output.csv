The commit includes the implementation of the `LLVMShuffleI16VectorNode` class, which handles shuffling 16-bit integer vectors in LLVM. The class extends `LLVMExpressionNode` and provides a `doI8Vector` specialization method for shuffling the vector elements based on the provided mask vector. The method concatenates the values of the left and right vectors, and then uses the mask vector to determine the order of the elements in the result vector. The commit also includes the necessary changes in the `BasicNodeFactory` class to generate instances of `LLVMShuffleI16VectorNode` when required.

Updated the MediaCodecVideoRenderer class by adding a new member variable called `pendingOutputStreamSwitchTimesUs`. This variable is used to store the switch times of pending output stream offsets.

Also added a new member variable called `lastInputTimeUs` to track the last input time in microseconds.

Some methods were modified to handle the new variables appropriately:

- `onStreamChanged()`: Added code to populate `pendingOutputStreamSwitchTimesUs` with the last input time.
- `reset()` and `renderOutputBufferToSurface()`: Added code to reset `lastInputTimeUs` to `C.TIME_UNSET` as needed.
- `onQueueInputBuffer()`: Set `lastInputTimeUs` to the maximum value between the buffer time and `lastInputTimeUs`.
- `onProcessedOutputBuffer()`: Added new code to handle pending output stream offsets based on `presentationTimeUs` and `pendingOutputStreamSwitchTimesUs`.

These changes improve the functionality and performance of the MediaCodecVideoRenderer class.",Fix issue with pending output stream offsets.,"Fix pending stream offset activation in video renderer.

Currently, pending stream offset changes are kept until an output buffer
timestamp surpasses the next pending stream offset. However, this is
problematic if the next stream offset overlaps with the current output
buffer sample times (e.g. because the next stream starts at a non-zero start
time).

To correctly time the switch to the next stream offset, this change keeps
the timestamp of the last queued input sample as switch point. And we only
switch to the new offset after an output sample timestamp reached this switch
point.

- Modified persistConfigurationForDataSource() method to include encrypt rule configuration.
- Modified assertPersisteConfigurationForEncrypt() test case to verify the persistence of encrypt rule configuration.","feat(configuration): Add persistEncryptRuleConfiguration method

This commit adds the persistEncryptRuleConfiguration method to the ConfigurationService class. This method persists the encrypt rule configuration for a given sharding schema name. It checks that the encrypt rule configuration is not null and that it has at least one encryptor rule configuration. The method then marshals the encrypt rule configuration to YAML format and persists it in the registry center.

Additionally, this commit adds a test case to verify the behavior of the persistConfiguration method when called with an encrypt rule configuration.

Refactor DMLIntegrateTest.java to improve code readability and maintainability,"Refactor dataset assertion code in DMLIntegrateTest

This commit refactors the dataset assertion code in the DMLIntegrateTest class. It improves code readability and organization by extracting the assertion logic into a separate method called ""assertDataSet"". The ""assertDataSet"" method takes in the actual prepared statement, actual data node, expected dataset rows, and expected dataset metadata as parameters. It then iterates over the result set and compares the actual result set data with the expected data using the ""isMatch"" method. Finally, it asserts the count of records for the data node.

Also RTL layout direction is incorrectly identified as LTR during layout sometimes, which makes the text being rendered with incorrect offset.

This change sets the paddings correctly removing the need of manual offsetting during onDraw() and relies purely on TextView for its text rendering.

Added @Lazy annotation in WebMvcAutoConfigurationAdapter constructor","feat: Add Lazy annotation to HttpMessageConverters in WebMvcAutoConfiguration

This commit adds the @Lazy annotation to the HttpMessageConverters parameter in the WebMvcAutoConfigurationAdapter constructor to improve performance by deferring the initialization of the HttpMessageConverters bean. Additionally, a new test case is added to ensure that a custom HttpMessageConverter that uses ConversionService does not create a cycle.","Refactor WebMvcAutoConfiguration and WebMvcAutoConfigurationTests

Introduce Lazy loading for HttpMessageConverters within WebMvcAutoConfigurationAdapter and add a new test case for a custom HttpMessageConverter that uses ConversionService.","Allow HttpMsgConverter to depend on ConvService without creating a cycle

In an MVC web application, DelegatingWebMvcConfiguration provides the
ConversionService while also consuming WebMvcConfigurerAdapters that,
among other things, can configure HTTP message converters. Boot's
WebMvcConfigurerAdapter, WebMvcAutoConfigurationAdapter, consumes
the HttpMessageConverters bean and uses it to configure Spring MVC's
HTTP message converters. This can create a bean dependency cycle if
an HTTP message converter bean depends, directly or indirectly on
the ConversionService. An example of the cycle is:

┌─────┐
|  jsonComponentConversionServiceCycle.ThingDeserializer defined in …
↑     ↓
|  org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.web.WebMvcAutoConfiguration$EnableWebMvcConfiguration
↑     ↓
|  org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.web.WebMvcAutoConfiguration$WebMvcAutoConfigurationAdapter
↑     ↓
|  org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.web.HttpMessageConvertersAutoConfiguration
↑     ↓
|  mappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter defined in class path resource [org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/web/JacksonHttpMessageConvertersConfiguration$MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverterConfiguration.class]
↑     ↓
|  jacksonObjectMapper defined in class path resource [org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/jackson/JacksonAutoConfiguration$JacksonObjectMapperConfiguration.class]
└─────┘

This commit breaks the cycle by making WebMvcAutoConfigurationAdapter
consume HttpMessageConverters lazily. This allows the adapter to be
created without triggered instantiation of every HTTP message
converter bean and all their dependencies. This allows it to be
injected into DelegatingWebMvcConfiguration without triggering an
attempt to retrieve the ConversionService.

`depset` constructor has new arguments, `direct` and `transitive`.
`items` argument is deprecated and after its removal `direct` will
become a sole positional argument.
If `transitive` and `items` are specified, `items` must be a list of
direct elements.
In the absence of `transitive` the value of `items` can also be a
depset, but that behavior is deprecated.

When using nested sets, we reuse sub-fingerprint computations by using the nested set key cache. map_each is supported.

All formats, before_each, join_with and so on are computed via adding a specific UUID to the fingerprint + the control string (eg. the format string) rather than performing the actual computation.

In legacy mode (existence of old map_fn), it falls back to trivial (and slow) fingerprint calculation.

Null Values due to token limit,Null Values due to token limit,Null Values due to token limit,"Treat parsed option values differently by option type.

There is a vexingly large world of possible option types, each with its own quirks of how it interfaces with new inputs as they come in: values can be
- overridden (default)
- concatenated (allowMultiple)
- flattened (allowMultiple that accepts list inputs)
- disappear into additional flag inputs (expansion flags)
Or some combination of the above, in the case of flags with implicit dependencies and wrapper options.

Begin removing the error-prone treatment of all option types with conditional branches. This model of the different options will make it much easier to isolate the option-type specific logic with the command-line parsing logic. Flags that affect other flags (implicit requirements, expansions, and wrappers) will be migrated in a later change.

Summary:
**motivation** :
when I download some images with media variations feature enabled, then I got some entries written to the media variations index database, but if I cleared all the previous cached  images (or load the same image while writing index info to the db) , and reload those images again, I would got duplicate entries with the same mediaId, width, height and resourceId pointing to the same disk cache key

**reproduce steps** :
0. check out current master branch
1.  just run example/media-variations
2. click to load all the images
3. then click the ""Clear cache and reset"" menu
4. reload all those images again
5. repeat step 3 and 4 if you want
6. pull the media-variations index database from the test device, open it using a sqlite3 client and query all entries from media_variations_index table
7. ***observable result*** : you would find more than one entries with identical mediaId, width, height, resourceId, cache_key and resource_id (except the auto generated primary key)

Null Values due to token limit,Null Values due to token limit,Null Values due to token limit,"HTTP/2 Simplify Headers Decode Bounds Checking

Motivation:
The HPACK decoder keeps state so that the decode method can be called multiple times with successive header fragments. This decoder also requires that a method is called to signify the decoding is complete. At this point status is returned to indicate if the max header size has been violated. Netty always accumulates the header fragments into a single buffer before attempting to HPACK decode process and so keeping state and delaying notification that bounds have been exceeded is not necessary.

Modifications:
- HPACK Decoder#decode(..) now must be called with a complete header block
- HPACK will terminate immediately if the maximum header length, or maximum number of headers is exceeded
- Reduce member variables in the HPACK Decoder class because they can now live in the decode(..) method

Result:
HPACK bounds checking is done earlier and less class state is needed."

This commit updates the StarlarkRuleTransitionProviderTest class to modify the _impl method in the transitions.bzl file.

This commit adds a custom random access strategy and a filter first filter strategy to the XFilteredQuery class. It also updates the FilteredQueryParser class to support different filter strategies. The filter strategy is determined by the ""strategy"" field in the query definition. If the value is ""query_filter"" or ""queryFirst"", the filter strategy is set to QUERY_FIRST_FILTER_STRATEGY. If the value is ""random_access_random"" or ""randomAccessAlways"", the filter strategy is set to ALWAYS_RANDOM_ACCESS_FILTER_STRATEGY. If the value is ""leap_frog"" or ""leapFrog"", the filter strategy is set to LEAP_FROG_QUERY_FIRST_STRATEGY. If the value starts with ""random_access_"" or ""randomAccess"", a custom random access filter strategy is created with the threshold specified in the value. If the value is ""leap_frog_query_first"" or ""leapFrogQueryFirst"", the filter strategy is set to LEAP_FROG_QUERY_FIRST_STRATEGY. If the value is ""leap_frog_filter_first"" or ""leapFrogFilterFirst"", the filter strategy is set to LEAP_FROG_FILTER_FIRST_STRATEGY.

"Refactor code in `addAndMarkAlias` method to improve readability and eliminate redundancy

In `addAndMarkAlias` method, remove the condition `node.recordsUsages()` as it is redundant. This is because the method `node.usages()` is called on `node` regardless of this condition. 

Replace the `if` statement with a loop that iterates over `node.usages()` and calls `markVirtualUsages(usage)` for each `usage`. This eliminates the need for the conditional check and reduces code duplication.

By making these changes, the code becomes more concise and easier to understand.","refactor: Update addAndMarkAlias method to handle all node usages

The accept method is added with an additional parameter `executor` to the `Collector` class. This parameter allows users to specify the executor used to enqueue the storage request. This change ensures that requests that block callers (such as http or gRPC) do not add additional load during such events.

While making this change, the `acceptSpans` method is added to handle decoding the spans from a byte buffer.

This commit adds support for handling the 100-continue header automatically and manually. It includes changes to the `HttpServerImpl`, `Http2ServerResponseImpl`, `VertxHttp2Handler`, `VertxHttp2HandlerBuilder`, and `Http2Test` classes. 

The changes allow the server to respond with a 100-continue status when the client sends an expectation header with a value of ""100-continue"". The server can handle the 100-continue response automatically or manually, based on the server configuration. 

When the server handles the 100-continue response manually, the `Http2ServerResponseImpl` class writes the continue headers to the encoder and flushes the context. 

When the server handles the 100-continue response automatically, the `VertxHttp2HandlerBuilder` class checks for the ""expect"" header and writes a continue response to the request when necessary. 

The `Http2Test` class includes tests for both manual and automatic handling of the 100-continue response.

In order to guard against deletions of ZooKeeper nodes which are still being used
by a different ZooKeeperStateHandleStore, we have to introduce a locking mechanism.
Only after all ZooKeeperStateHandleStores have released their lock, the ZNode is
allowed to be deleted.

THe locking mechanism is implemented via ephemeral child nodes of the respective
ZooKeeper node. Whenever a ZooKeeperStateHandleStore wants to lock a ZNode, thus,
protecting it from being deleted, it creates an ephemeral child node. The node's
name is unique to the ZooKeeperStateHandleStore instance. The delete operations
will then only delete the node if it does not have any children associated.

In order to guard against oprhaned lock nodes, they are created as ephemeral nodes.
This means that they will be deleted by ZooKeeper once the connection of the

"- Added support for SkylarkNestedSet in the 'inputs' parameter of 'action' method

This commit adds support for `depset` inputs in Skylark actions. Previously, only `SkylarkList` inputs were supported. Now, both `SkylarkList` and `SkylarkNestedSet` inputs are allowed in the `inputs` parameter of the `@SkylarkCallable` annotation.

This change also updates the implementation of the `invoke()` method in the `SkylarkRuleImplementationFunctions` class to handle `SkylarkNestedSet` inputs correctly. If `inputs` is a `SkylarkNestedSet`, the nested set is converted to a collection of `Artifact` objects, and the artifacts are added to the `SpawnAction.Builder` using the `addInputs` method.

The existing unit test cases in `SkylarkRuleImplementationFunctionsTest` are updated to test the new functionality. A new test case is added to verify that a `depset` input can be used in a Skylark action.

Original description:
Change getLauncher to return both a stripped and unstripped launcher binary
artifact under fission, instead of invoking getLauncher twice. This was
setting up two identical link actions that required later work to filter
out the redundant action in filterSharedActionsAndThrowActionConflict.
This becomes extremely inefficient under ThinLTO, where each launcher link
is actually 1 LTO indexing action, N LTO Backend actions, and 1 native link
action.

  were met, regardless of whether there was any work to do.

As discovered whilst investigating #6798, there are cases
where these methods are not correctly. They were added as
convenience methods that could be overridden by concrete
DownloadService implementations, but since they don't work
properly it's preferable to require application code to
listen to their DownloadManager directly instead.

Notes:

- The original proposal to fix #6798 stored the state change
events in memory until they could be delivered. This approach
is not ideal because the events still end up being delivered
later than they should be. We also want to fix the root cause
in a different way that does not require doing this.
- This change does not fix #6798. It's a preparatory step.

This commit refactors the `loadReporterFactories` method to improve the loading of metric reporter factories. It now uses a combination of `ServiceLoader` and a custom plugin manager to load available reporter factories. The new `loadAvailableReporterFactories` method also provides better error handling by catching individual `ServiceConfigurationErrors` and logging them.

Additionally, the commit adds logging statements to provide more information about the found reporter factories. It logs the class name of the factory and the location of the JAR file containing the factory class.

Finally, the commit updates the `setupReporters` method to use the new `loadAvailableReporterFactories` method and handle multiple implementations of the same reporter.

This commit refactors the loadInitData and loadMedia methods in the HlsMediaChunk class. It introduces a new private method feedDataToExtractor to handle the feeding of data to the extractor. The nextLoadPosition variable now refers to the media segment if initDataLoadRequired is false, and to the init segment otherwise. Additionally, the code has been reorganized to improve readability.

This change provides a cleaner and more efficient implementation for loading and feeding data to the extractor in HlsMediaChunk.

Null Values due to token limit,Null Values due to token limit,Null Values due to token limit,"Disallow setting logger factory twice

Motivation:

InternalLoggerFactory either sets a default logger factory
implementation based on the logging implementations on the classpath, or
applications can set a logger factory explicitly. If applications wait
too long to set the logger factory, Netty will have already set a logger
factory leading to some objects using one logging implementation and
other objets using another logging implementation. This can happen too
if the application tries to set the logger factory twice, which is
likely a bug in the application. Yet, the Javadocs for
InternalLoggerFactory warn against this saying that
InternalLoggerFactory#setLoggerFactory ""should be called as early as
possible and shouldn't be called more than once"". Instead, Netty should
guard against this.

Modications:

We replace the logger factory field with an atomic reference on which we
can do CAS operations to safely guard against it being set twice. We
also add an internal holder class that captures the static interface of
InternalLoggerFactory that can aid in testing.

Result:

The logging factory can not be set twice, and applications that want to
set the logging factory must do it before any Netty classes are
initialized (or the default logger factory will be set)."

Related Jira ticket: PROJECT-123",Add progress bar to ExperimentalEventHandler only if cursor control is enabled,"experimental UI: only redraw progress bar after event in curses mode

Whenever an event has to be reported to the scroll-back buffer, the old progress
bar has to be removed first. Afterwards, it is redrawn. In a setting without
cursor control, this, however, litters the log with lots status bars. Therefore,
only redraw the progress bar after an event if cursor control is available. Note
that the refresh thread will eventually ensure an up-to-date progress bar anyway.

"Add support for configuring keep-alive pings for outgoing gRPC connections

Move the TLS authority override option to AuthAndTLSOptions file

Add support for configuring keep-alive time and timeout for outgoing gRPC connections in GoogleAuthUtils","feat: Add options for configuring gRPC keep-alive

Add new options `grpc_keepalive_time` and `grpc_keepalive_timeout` to configure keep-alive pings for outgoing gRPC connections. These options allow Bazel to send keep-alive pings after a specified duration of no read operations on the connection. By default, keep-alive pings are disabled. This change also updates the `GoogleAuthUtils` class to set the keep-alive time and timeout values on the gRPC channel builder if the options are provided.

Closes #123",Add support for configuring keep-alive pings in gRPC connections,"Add --grpc_keepalive_time/grpc_keepalive_timeout

This allows controlling keep-alive pings in the gRPC library. We have
seen cases where GCP's external TCP load balancer silently drops
connections without telling the client. If this happens when the client
is waiting for replies from the server (e.g., when all worker threads
are in blocking 'execute' calls), then the client does not notice the
connection loss and hangs.

In our testing, the client unblocked after ~2 hours without this change,
although we are not sure why (maybe a default Linux Kernel timeout on
TCP connections?). With this flag set to 10 minutes, and running builds
over night, we see repeated 10-minute gaps in remote service utilization,
which seems pretty clear evidence that this is the underlying problem.

The gRPC library has two settings: keep-alive time and keep-alive
timeout. The keep-alive time is the time to wait after the most recent
received packet before sending a keep-alive ping, and the keep-alive
timeout is the time to wait for a reply before concluding that the
connection is dead. The default keep-alive timeout setting is 20s, but
the default keep-alive time setting is infinity (i.e., disable
keep-alive pings).

The gRPC documentation also says to ask the service owner before enabling
keep-alive pings based on the concern that these could generate a lot of
hidden traffic. I don't immediately see how these concerns apply to the
REAPI, and the REAPI also does not have a single service owner. For now,
I'm making this opt-in.

This is difficult to test automatically because there is no easy way to
drop a TCP connection without telling the other end point (for good
reason!).

- Adding assertions to ensure the validity of shiftNum
- Restructuring the code for bitSize == 32 and bitSize == 64 separately
- Simplifying the condition check for adding/subtracting value based on c and magicNum
- Replacing the creation of the quot variable with the value variable directly
- Incorporating sign adjustment based on c and dividendStamp to the value variable
- Returning the computed value as the final result

Added encryptor configuration to result in toTableRuleConfiguration method","feat: Add support for encryptor configuration in YamlTableRuleConfiguration

This commit adds a new field, `encryptor`, to the YamlTableRuleConfiguration class. The field represents the encryptor configuration for the table rule. The field is initialized with the value from the equivalent field in the TableRuleConfiguration class, if it is not null. When converting the YamlTableRuleConfiguration instance to a TableRuleConfiguration instance, the encryptor configuration is set on the resulting object if the encryptor field is not null.

The purpose of this change is to provide support for encryptor configuration in the YAML-based table rule configuration.",Add encryptor to YamlTableRuleConfiguration,add encryptor

The previous implementation of the hash code caching strategy in the SkyKey class was flawed. This commit replaces the cacheHashCode method with the computeHashCode method, which correctly computes and caches the hash code value. The new strategy is based on the one used by java.lang.String, where a value of 0 indicates that the hash code hasn't been computed and cached yet. Additionally, the hashCode field is non-volatile and non-final, allowing for potential issues with visibility. However, these issues are considered benign from a correctness perspective.",Optimize the hash code caching strategy in SkyKey class.,"Fix race condition in SkyKey#hashCode by using the hashCode caching strategy employed by java.lang.String.

Consider the case where thread T1 calls cacheHashCode and then in the future thread T2 calls hashCode.

"Fix bug in provision request handling

The provision request was being sent multiple times when it was already in progress, causing an issue. This has been fixed by checking if the request is already in progress before sending it.

Mark provisioning as in progress

When making a provision request, mark the provisioning as in progress to avoid sending multiple requests simultaneously. This ensures that the request is handled correctly.

Fix stale provision response issue

There was an issue where the provision response was being processed even when the state was not in the expected states. This has been fixed by checking the state before processing the response.","feat: Add provisioningInProgress flag

Add a new flag to track if provisioning is currently in progress or not. This flag is used in the postProvisionRequest() method to prevent multiple provisioning requests from being sent simultaneously.

In ServerPropertiesTests, the following changes were made:
- Removed the import statement for ServerProperties.
- Refactored the testPortBinding method to use the assertEquals method for Integer values.","Ensure ServerProperties default values does not override

Since ServerProperties had primitive properties for port (in
particular) it was not possible to check when applying those
properties if the user had actually changed the value. This
in turn meant that a custom EmbeddedServletContainerFactory
could not set the default values.

Fixed by making int properties of ServerProperties into
Integer and checking for null before setting on the
container factory.

Refactor the code in LocalExifThumbnailProducer to improve the handling of image encoding. Instead of directly creating an EncodedImage object with a CloseableReference, the code now uses a try-finally block to properly close the CloseableReference after it is used to create the EncodedImage object.

Also, update the test case in LocalExifThumbnailProducerTest to reflect the changes in the number of references that should be open after producing results. The test now expects only 2 references to be open: the cloned reference when the argument is captured by EncodedImage and the one created when getByteBufferRef is called on EncodedImage.",Fix resource leak in LocalExifThumbnailProducer,"Fix leaked reference in LocalExifThumbnailProducer.buildEncodedImage()

Summary:
Closes https://github.com/facebook/fresco/issues/314

The original reference is not closed explicitly and gets closed when garbage-collected.  The following test proves that:
```java
  Test
  public void testFindExifThumbnail() {
    mTestLocalExifThumbnailProducer.produceResults(mConsumer, mProducerContext);
    mTestExecutorService.runUntilIdle();
    // Should have 3 references open: The reference that is used in the producer, the cloned
    // reference when the argument is captured and one more that is created when getByteBufferRef is

The test ensures that the stream ID is correctly set in the decoded `FullHttpResponse` headers.

The change also includes a modification to the decode method in the Http2StreamFrameToHttpObjectCodec class. The method now retrieves the stream ID from the `Http2FrameStream` if it is not null, otherwise, it sets the stream ID to 0.

Handle CallAsync messages:
- Modify the handleCallAsync method to check if the callable field is null. If it is null, log a warning message and send a failure response to the sender.

Handle RunAsync messages:
- Modify the handleRunAsync method to check if the runnable field is null. If it is null, log a warning message.
- Check the timeToRun value. If it is 0 or the delay time (timeToRun - System.nanoTime()) is less than or equal to 0, execute the runnable immediately.
- If the delay time is greater than 0, schedule the runnable to be executed after the delay time.

As of 4a5e1b7, it was using getErrorPath twice, which could cause it to
loop indefinitely, trying to append the error file to itself. This
happened rarely, as the test runner script redirects stderr to stdout.
However, it could happen if the SpawnRunner wrote any extra output to
stderr, which the RemoteSpawnRunner does in some cases.

I have manually checked that this fixes the issue, and also added a
regression test.

all the classes that extend ElasticsearchException, but these classes
can not be loaded because ElasticsearchException has not finished its

The code diff adds support for multitouch input by modifying the `AndroidInput` and `AndroidMultiTouchHandler` classes. 

In the `AndroidInput` class, the arrays `touchX`, `touchY`, `touched`, and `realId` are resized from 40 to 20 to accommodate up to 20 touch events. The `getFreePointerIndex` method is added to find a free pointer index, and the `lookUpPointerIndex` method is added to find the index of a specific pointer ID.

In the `AndroidMultiTouchHandler` class, the `onTouch` method is updated to use the `realId` array to keep track of pointer IDs. When a new touch event occurs (ACTION_DOWN or ACTION_POINTER_DOWN), a free pointer index is obtained using `getFreePointerIndex`, and the pointer ID is stored in the `realId` array. When a touch event ends (ACTION_UP, ACTION_POINTER_UP, ACTION_OUTSIDE, or ACTION_CANCEL), the pointer index is obtained using `lookUpPointerIndex`, and the corresponding pointer ID is cleared from the `realId` array. During a touch move event, the `lookUpPointerIndex` is used to find the pointer index for each pointer ID.

"Fix issue with stream ID in Http2ServerTest

The stream ID in Http2ServerTest was not being set correctly. This caused the assertion in the test to fail. This fix ensures that the stream ID is set correctly before making assertions on it.","feat: Add streamId method to HttpServerRequest interface and Http2ServerRequestImpl class

This commit adds a new method called `streamId` to the `HttpServerRequest` interface and implements it in the `Http2ServerRequestImpl` class. The `streamId` method returns the id of the stream of the request. It returns -1 when the stream id is not yet determined or when the request has not been sent or is not supported in HTTP/1.x.

"feat: Add special WebSphere request attribute for original request URI

This commit adds a new field, WEBSPHERE_URI_ATTRIBUTE, to the UrlPathHelper class. This field is a static final String that represents the special WebSphere request attribute for the original request URI. This attribute is preferable over the standard Servlet 2.4 forward attribute on WebSphere because it provides access to the very first URI in the request forwarding chain.

The WEBSPHERE_URI_ATTRIBUTE is used in the getOriginatingRequestUri method to retrieve the original request URI. If the attribute is set, it is used as the URI. Otherwise, the method falls back to the standard forward attribute (WebUtils.FORWARD_REQUEST_URI_ATTRIBUTE) and then the request URI if both attributes are not set.

Overall, this commit improves the handling of forwarded requests and ensures the correct resolution of the request URI.","refactor: Update UrlPathHelper to use a special WebSphere request attribute

The code diff updates the UrlPathHelper class to use a special WebSphere request attribute, ""com.ibm.websphere.servlet.uri_non_decoded"", to retrieve the original request URI. This attribute is preferred over the standard Servlet 2.4 forward attribute on WebSphere. Additionally, the code removes the reliance on the Servlet 2.4 forward attributes, as they may be set by other components when running in a Servlet 2.3 environment.",Add support for retrieving the original request URI in WebSphere environments,JSP FormTag calculates proper default form action even when using a rewrite filter on WebSphere (SPR-7067)

"feat: Add getPackageRelativeTreeArtifact method to RuleContext class

The getPackageRelativeTreeArtifact method creates a tree artifact in a directory that is unique to the package that contains the rule, guaranteeing that it never clashes with artifacts created by rules in other packages.

The newDirectory method is an experimental method that creates a directory artifact with a given name. If a sibling artifact is provided, the new directory artifact is created next to the sibling artifact. If no sibling artifact is provided, the new directory artifact is created in the package relative directory.
